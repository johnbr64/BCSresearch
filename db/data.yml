    - The Death of Distance
    - "Cairncross discusses the impact of pervasive, high-speed networks on society.
      \ She notes that distance is no longer a factor in communications.  One example
      is the fact that telephone companies now sometimes route local calls in the
      US through Europe during high traffic periods.  Cairncross notes the development
      of \"Communities of Practice.\"  These are groups that form around a shared
      interest or need, rather than due to geography.\r\n\r\nCairncross also notes
      the impact of wireless networks.  She notes that these networks have brought
      telephone to places where it has never been available before.  She compares
      the evolution of wireless telephony in the U.S. and in Europe and Asia.  She
      suggests that wireless communications is much more developed in Europe and Asia
      because they adopted a universal standard, which the U.S. did not."

    - The Innovator's Dilemma
    - "Christensen examines why well-run, successful businesses fail.  One reason
      is their inability to deal with disruptive technologies.  Christensen identifies
      several reasons for this inability.  One reason is that successful companies
      must listen to their customer's wants and needs.  Since disruptive technologies
      rarely address customers' current needs,the company's \"value networks\" will
      rarely tolerate resources being targeted to their development.  Also, disruptive
      technologies, because they tend to initially serve a small, niche market can
      rarely generate enough profit to allow them to meet the growth standards required
      by large, successful companies.  Large companies are much more successful in
      pursuing sustaining technologies, rather than disruptive technologies.\r\n\r\nUsing
      the disc drive and the mechanical excavator industries as case studies, Christensen
      demonstrates how disruptive technologies that develop in niche markets initially
      do not have the capabilities to meet mainstream market needs.  They improvement
      trend lines tend to be steeper that those for sustaining technologies and they
      eventually intersect the criteria of mainstream customers. At this point, large
      companies with sustaining technologies can not compete and attempt to go up
      market.\r\n\r\nChristensen suggests that companies that wish to foster disruptive
      technologies spin off or build autonomous entities that can serve a small market
      which needs the disruptive technology.  This will allow resources to flow to
      the development of the product.  The organizations must be small enough to get
      excited about small gains. He also warns that managers must plan on failures
      and marshal resources so that development can continue after initial failure."

    - What Just Happened
    - "The book offers a series of essays about the technology written by the author
      between August, 1992 and April 2001.  The essays deal with a wide variety of
      issues pertaining to the technology of the day and offer an interesting chronicle
      of the rapid evolution and integration of technology into society. \r\n\r\nSeveral
      essays comment on Microsoft's \"buggy\" software and aggressive business practices.
      \ Gleick also discusses topics that range from pornography on the web to e-commerce.
      \ Gleick's style is humorous and irreverent.\r\n\r\nOne interesting essay, \"Patently
      Absurd,\" looks at the how individuals and corporations have attempted to patent
      even mundane ideas in the hope that they might someday be used in the development
      of a successful product.  Written in March of 2000, the essay foretells of the
      complexity of determining and protecting intellectual property in the digital
      age.\r\n\r\nGleick deals with privacy issues, pointing out that the concern
      about the \"right\" to privacy is a relatively new phenomenon.  That societies
      historically have not treated privacy with any particular respect.  He points
      out that technology has allowed the collection of a tremendous amount of data
      on individuals, but that it has been accomplished in exchange for better services."

    - 'Einstein 1905: The Standard of Greatness'
    - "Albert Einstein published five of his most important papers.  The first paper,
      published on March 18, 1905, in Annalen der Physik, was entitled \"On a Heuristic
      Point of View about the Creation and Conversion of Light.\"  This paper was
      both revolutionary and controversial because it challenged the accepted theory
      that light was a wave.  Eistein showed that light was actually made up of particles
      or Quantums.  He did this by demonstrating that light when focused on inside
      of a metal lined container, dislodged electrons from the metal.  This dispelled
      the theory the ether.\r\n\r\nEinstein's second paper entitled, \"A New Determination
      of Molecular Dimensions,\" was complete on April 30, 2005.  This was Einstein's
      dissertation.  Einstein submitted two papers for his dissertation before this
      paper.  Both were rejected.  One rejected paper described the Theory of Special
      Relativity. Einstein chose this paper as his dissertation because he viewed
      it as the least novel or startling. In this paper, Einstein developed a formula
      for measuring molecules in liquids.  He thus proved the existance of atoms,
      which some noted scientists still rejected.\r\n\r\nEinstein's May paper was
      entitled, \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids
      Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"  In this paper, Einstein
      showed that Brownian Motion was the result of large molecules bombarding small
      particles suspended in liquid.  This caused the particles to move in a zig zag
      motion.\r\n\r\nThe June paper entitled, \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,\"
      described the Special Theory of Relativity.  In this, Einstein demonstrated
      the relationship between space and time.  He showed that people in different
      places will view the same thing differently.  He also showed that a steel beam
      that is measured by a moving individual and a stationary individual will be
      two different sizes.  He  determined that the speed of light was nature's speed
      limit.\r\n\r\nThe final paper from 1905 was entitled, \"Does the Inertia of
      a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?\"  This paper introduced the concept that
      Mass and Energy were the same thing.  This was described by the famous formula
      e=mc2."

    - 'Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable Genetic Future'
    - "The book describes the implications of bioengineering on the future development
      of humans.  Stock contends that, while the issue raises significant moral, ethical
      and cultural issues, the process will continue to evolve.  He suggests that
      this will be done through the manipulation of the germline. He rejects the idea
      of surgically implanting chips in the body since it would be needlessly complex.
      He notes with the minaturization of technology there will be no need for implants.\r\n\r\nWith
      the mapping of the human genome, Stock contends that physicians will be able
      to manipulate genes that will have a direct impact on their characteristics
      and health.  He notes that research on worms found that one gene mutation almost
      doubled the worm's life span.  Knowledge of a person's genetics may allow pharmacists
      to customize medicines for individuals.\r\n\r\nStock noted that the cloning
      of animals was providing scarce genetic materials that can be used to treat
      hemophelia and other diseases.  He states that it is commercially attractive
      applications such as these that are driving cloning, not the desire to reproduce
      humans.\r\n\r\nGenetics account for 35% to 75% of characteristics that we consider
      important.  IQ is 45% to 75% heritable. \r\n\r\nThe Dialogue on the Two Chief
      World Systems remained on the Index of Prohibited Books until 1992 (more than
      two centuries), when Pope John Paul II admitted that the Vatican and Pope Urban
      VIII had erred.\r\n\r\nStock also introduces the concept of artificial chromosomes
      that may switch on or off to achieve a desired result."

    - Nanotechnology and Homeland Security
    - "This book examines the application of nanotechnology to homeland security.
      \ It focuses on seven major areas: materials, sensors, biomedical nanostructures,
      energy, electronics, optics, and fabrication.  Carbon nanotubes were discovered
      in the early 1990's and represent the strongest, stiffest and most conducive
      materials ever developed. Scientists at the University of Dallas have incorporated
      nanotube fibers into cloth that is seventeen time stronger than Kevlar.  \r\n\r\nThe
      development of sensors is one of the major applications of nanotechnology in
      the field of security and defense.  Nanosensors can be used to identify chemical
      and biological threats such as Anthrax.  Biomedical nanostructures interact
      with molecular structures to deliver medicine more efficiently and precisely.
      \ Other applications include adhesive materials for skin grafts, oxygen barrier
      structures, etc.\r\n\r\nTitania nanoparticles may be used to capture electricity
      from the sun.  Electronics, the authors point out, already exist at the nanoscale,
      but nanotechnology will continue to reduce the size of circuits to the molecular
      level.  Nanowires may also be used to dissipate static electricity.  Nanoscale
      particles take on new properties pertaining to color.  This may allow the development
      of active camouflage which would automatically adjust to its surroundings and
      provide protection to soldiers.\r\nNanofabrication includes the use of nanoscale
      pens to write very thin lines of molecules on a surface.\r\n\r\nOther facts
      and possibilities:\r\n1. The U.S. Army has already spent $50 million to create
      a Center for Soldier Nanotechnologies at MIT.\r\n2. Night Vision gear is based
      on nanotechnology.\r\n3. Nanotechnology has allowed the development of fire
      protection glass.\r\n4. Nanotechnology allows precise and efficient administration
      of drugs that will increase effectiveness and decrease cost.\r\n5. By 2015,
      the NSF predicts that nanotechnology could increase the GNP by $1-$2 Trillion
      dollars per year.\r\n6. The Nanotechnology Initiative was started by the Clinton
      administration and is now funded at $1 billion per year."

    - Prepared Remarks at National Education Summit on High School
    - "This is a speech by Bill Gates given at the National Education Summit on High
      Schools.  In his speech, Gates declared that America's high schools are \"obsolete.\"
      \ He noted that two barriers exist to students being able to access higher education.
      \ The first is economic.  The second is lack of preparation.  These barriers,
      he contended, are more prevelant among minority students and seriously impede
      equity.  This threatens the United States' position in the global marketplace.\r\n\r\nGates
      cites statistics that show that U.S. students start out among the highest in
      math and science. By the eighth grade they are at the middle of the pack and
      by the 12th grade they are at the bottom of all industrialized nations.  He
      notes that China graduates twice as many college graduates as the U.S. and six
      times as many engineers.\r\n\r\nGates suggests that it is not a problem with
      the U.S. system of education that leads to the inequities and lack of preparation
      of minority students, but that it is the system working as designed.  He calls
      for a \"redesigning\" of America's high schools based on three principles, which
      he calls the Three R's:\r\n\r\n1. Rigor - Making sure that all students are
      given a challenging curriculum that prepares them for college and work,\r\n2.
      Relevancy - Making sure that all courses relate to students' aspirations and
      goals,\r\n3. Relationships - Making sure that their are adults that know students,
      look out for them, and push them to achieve.\r\n\r\nGates lists three actions
      that Governors should take to achieve the above:\r\n\r\n1. Declare that all
      students should graduate from high school prepared for college, work and citizenship,\r\n2.
      Publish data pertaining to our progress towards that goal,\r\n3. Turn around
      failing schools and open new ones.\r\n\r\nGates sites several examples of redesigned
      schools that have show substantial improvement including:\r\n\r\n1. Kansas City,
      Kansas Public Schools,\r\n2. The Met School in Providence, RI,\r\n3. High Tech
      High in San Diego, CA."

    - 'Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea'
    - "This book provides an introduction to the field of Nanotechnology.  The authors
      explain that the prefix Nano means one billionth.  A human hair is 50,000 nanometers
      across. One nanometer is equal to just 10 hydrogen atoms lined up.  The authors
      state that nanostructures are the smallest solid things able to be made.  Nanotechnology,
      in turn, is the useful application of these nanostructures into nanoscale devices.\r\n\r\nThe
      federal government spent $422 million on nano research in 2001.  It allocated
      $600 million in 2002, even though the request was only for $519 million.  The
      National Science Foundation predicted that nano-related goods and services could
      represent a $1 trillion market by 2015.\r\n\r\nAt the nanoscale, the property
      of elements changes. For instance, the color, melting point and chemical properties
      of gold change at the nanoscale.  Properties such as conductivity also change.
      \ Working at the nanoscale to build things is called \"Nanofabrication.\"  Top-down
      nanofabrication is when you start at a larger scale and gradually reduce a structure
      to a smaller size.  Bottom-up nanofabrication is when you build something, atom
      by atom.\r\n\r\nNature works at the nanoscale creating complex structures necessary
      for life such as DNA.  The ability of one molecule to attract and bind to another
      is called molecular recognition.  This process is a very important feature in
      nanotechnology.  It allows molecules to organize themselves on their own or
      with a supporting plastic or metal structure.  This is very important in nanomanufacturing.
      \ Molecular recognition is important in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
      It can be used to identify tumors and can also assist in the distribution of
      medicine within the body, thus increasing \"bioavailability.\"  DNA molecular
      therapy, also called gene therapy, takes advantage of DNA's self-binding property.
      \ It may be possible to insert DNA into the body targeted for a specific disease-causing
      DNA strand.  It could then bind to the strand and keep it from replicating.\r\n\r\nFact:
      \ It is now possible for a scientist in Washington, D.C. to move a single atom
      across a platform in a lab in San Jose over the Internet.\r\n\r\nTools used
      in nanotechnology include scanning tunneling microscopes and magnetic force
      microscopes. Scanning-Probe Microscopes are used not only to view structures,
      but also to manipulate them.  They may be used to move individual atoms or molecules.\r\n\r\nNanoscale
      smart materials are materials that are engineered at the nanoscale to perform
      a specific task.  An example would be self-tinting automotive glass.\r\n\r\nUsing
      the property of molecular recognition, scientists are developing ultrasensitive
      nanoscale sensors.  Sensors have already been developed that can identify Anthrax
      in small quantities. In the area of medicine, scientists are creating biostructures
      using the self-assembly property of nanostructures.  Sam Strupp a professor
      at Northwestern University has successfully created a self-assembling artificial
      bone.\r\n\r\nNanotechology has already had a significant impact on the electronics
      industry.  Using \"controlled feedback lithography,\" scientists have placed
      individual molecules on silicon chips and measured their conductivity.  This
      is a fundamental process in molecular electonics.  \r\n\r\nNanofiltration also
      promises to have a high level of economic significance.  Such structures may
      be used to separate gasses within the air and to remove toxins from streams.
      \ Nanocomposites also offer great promise in the air transportation industry
      due to their light weight and great strength.  This value may be increased given
      the ability to integrate self-healing properties into the structure.\r\n\r\nNanotechnology
      has already been introduced into the textile industry. Eddie Bauer used nanotechnology
      to create a stain resistant fabric.\r\n\r\nCarbon nanotubes \"represent an entirely
      new form of Matter.\"  They are stable and extremely strong.  \r\n\r\nResearch
      in the area of nanotechnology suggests that a bit of memory could be stored
      on a single molecule.\r\n\r\nNanotechnology will cross many existing industries.
      \ It's impact, though disruptive in nature, will be hidden.\r\n\r\nWilson's
      double core tennis balls use a nanocomposite clay to extend the life of the
      ball.\r\nNanoblat has introduced carbon nanotubes into their its rackets.\r\n\r\nThe
      authors conclude the book with a discussion on ethical issues associated with
      nanotechnology.  Some issues include: the issuance of patents and the potential
      of nanotechnology to increase the divide between rich and poor nations.  Also,
      the authors note, working at the level of the basis of life creates inherent
      ethical problems."

    - "This article discusses how online courses are becoming a growing option for
      K-12 students.  The article opens with a story about Jessica Brown, a junior
      at West Chester East High School, who needed to take an Advanced Placement biology
      course.  When her school could not offer the course she enrolled in a course
      provided by the Virtual High School located in Massachusetts. Students enrolled
      in courses offered by the Virtual High School receive credit from their own
      high schools.  High school teachers agree to lead courses for the VHS and, in
      return, 25 students can enroll in other courses.\r\n\r\nThe article noted that
      the Florida Virtual High School opened during the 1996-97 school year with 77
      students.  The school now serves more than 18,000 students.  One of the greatest
      advantages of virtual schools, the article states, is flexibility. Many students
      take online courses because their schedules are too full to take then during
      the regular school day. Some take courses because their school district cannot
      afford to offer the courses they need.  Others access the courses to make up
      work.\r\n\r\nNEA developed a policy statement that was supportive of distance
      learning's potential for expanding opportunities for students.  It cautioned
      against, however, creating schools that provide little opportunity for face-to-face
      interaction among students and teachers.  Of particular concern, according to
      the article, was the proliferation of cyber charter schools in which students
      take almost all of their instruction online.\r\n\r\nThe article concluded with
      an anecdote by Laura Hajdukiewicz that illustrated how connected the students
      participating in an online class can become.  She described how she had to break
      the news of the death of a student to her classmates. The bond that the students
      had formed was very evident in the responses."

    - Disposing of Idle Technology
    - "This is a case study describing the process that Kaiser Permanente followed
      in selecting a technology recycling and disposal service.  The company identified
      the following requirements:\r\n-Complete data erasure, protection againstlegal/environmental
      actions once equipment left our facilities\r\n-Support of numerous Kaiser facilities
      nationwide\r\n-Operational capacity for anticipated 90,000 to 100,000 IT assets
      to be dispositioned in any 3-year period\r\n-Processing capabilities for PCs,
      servers,networking equipment, etc.\r\n-Detailed reporting to satisfy regulatory
      complianceand internal asset control requirements, including tracking individual
      items via serial number\r\n-Comprehensive IT support to avoid burdens on our
      IT staff\r\n-Assurance that our equipment would not create unnecessary e-waste
      or end up in foreign landfills unprotected by EPA guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe company
      piloted the service using two OEM's and two IT disposition services.  The OEM's
      could not meet the requirements identified by the company and shifted too much
      of the burden onto Kaiser employees.  Both of the IT disposition services were
      capable of providing the service at the level required.\r\n\r\nKaiser finally
      selected Redemtech, Inc. of Columbus, Ohio.  The company provided bullet-proof
      distruction of data, detailed certification of responsible data destruction
      and EPA conforming disposal of equipment.  Kaiser processed 2,500 to 3,000 IT
      assets per month.  Using the service saved them approximately $250,000 per year
      in property costs and between $250,000 and $300,000 per year in property taxes."

    - Disposing of computers becoming a global concern
    - "This article focused on the growing concern over the disposal of technology
      waste.  The article pointed out that as people have purchased new computers,
      they have continued to store their old machines.  Small percentages of the equipment
      was recycled or trashed.  While some disposal services exist for commercial
      waste, none of these firms handled consumer waste.\r\n\r\nVarious computer components
      contain toxic materials.  The article states that 700 chemicals are used to
      manufacture a computer and approximately half of them are toxic.  The plastic
      casings, for instance, are treated with flame retardent and the computer monitors
      contain around 2 1/2 lbs. of lead.  In addition to computers, the article pointed
      out that 250 million television sets would become obsolete by the end of 2005
      when HDTV becomes the standard."

    - "This press release announced a complaint filed against Manhattan College by
      the EPA for hazardous waste violations.  The fine imposed totalled $111,199.
      The hazardous waste in question included mercury, arsenic, spent solvents, paint,
      used fluorescent light bulbs and used computer monitors.  The improper disposal
      of these items constituted a violation of the federal Resource Conservation
      and Recovery Act.\r\n\r\nThe EPA action was partially the result of Manhattan
      College's failure to agree to conduct a self-audit as allowed by the EPA Region
      2 Colleges and Universities Initiative.  The EPA, therefore, conducted an audit
      and discovered the waste."

    - Handling the Environmental Consequences of E-Waste
    - "This article provides a legal perspective on the growing problem of e-waste.
      \ The author is a member of a Delaware Valeey Law Firm (Manko, Gold, Katcher
      & Fox, LLP).\r\n\r\nThe author notes that authorities predicted that there would
      be 315 million obsolete computers in the United States by 2004. This leads to
      a serious problem as to the disposal of this waste which contains hazardous
      a variety of hazardous materials including approximately 5 to 7 pounds of lead.
      \ Lead is present in the monitors (CRTs) and the ciruit boards.  Other toxic
      chemicals include cadmium, mercury,and chromium.  There is also a concern with
      the potential incineration of computers since the bromiated flame retardent
      that is used to make computer cases flame retardant can lead to the release
      of toxic dioxins into the environment.\r\n\r\nThe author points out that the
      EPA has different disposal requirements for households and businesses.  Under
      the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) defines computers disposed
      of by businesses as hazardous waste, while this does not apply to computers
      disposed of by households.  This particularly applies to monitors containing
      CRTs.\r\n\r\nWhile the law states that businesses must exercise \"due diligence\"
      to ensure that computers are properly disposed of, the author states that what
      that means is not clearly articulated.  He points out that several states have
      taken enacted their own laws regarding e-waste.  \r\n\r\nMassachusetts became
      the first state to ban the direct disposal of computer monitors, televisions
      and video games containing CRTs.  Pennsylvania, on the other hand, took a more
      voluntary approach with household e-waste, providing incentives for municipalities
      to develop electronics pollution and collection programs.\r\n\r\nThe author
      highlighted programs initiated by corporations including a partnership between
      Waste Management and Sony.  IBM also was cited as having a program to refurbish
      and recycle computers.\r\n\r\nThe author cautions about the use of recycling
      firms that have been found to \"mine\" the equipment for valuable metals and
      other components and then dispose of the remaining waste in landfills.  The
      recommends auditing the firm to determine compliance with EPA standards for
      the disposal of hazardous waste.\r\n\r\nFinally, the author discusses the benefits
      of donating equipment.  He contends that this takes the equipment out of the
      solid waste stream and provides resources to needy organizations and individuals.
      \ He characterizes this as a \"win-win\" solution.  He provides examples of
      such organizations including: Nonprofit Technical Resources in Philadelphia.
      \ He also points out that Congress created an attractive tax incentive via the
      21st Century Classrooms Act for Private Technology Investment in 1998.  The
      Act allows businessess to deduct the full purchase costs of computers that they
      donate to K-12 schools."

    - "Gartner, Inc., the leading provider of research and analysis for the global
      IT industry, warned that IT managers must take into account the cost of disposing
      of end-of-life equipment when calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TOC).
      \ Gartner pointed out that this process can cost, on average, $85 - $136 per
      computer.  They note that this is more than the value of the equipment if resale
      is a consideration.\r\n\r\nGartner stated that this cost can be much higher
      if the equipment is not properly disposed of.  They note that businesses have
      reported fines of up to $200,000 fines for equipment that turned up in landfills.
      \ In addition, a public relations disaster has followed the discovery of computers
      that were disposed of without proper sanitization."

    - "This article appeared in the Online CPA Journal.  Additional authors included
      Waleed Abu El Ella, and Ronald M. Young.  The article discussed the growing
      problem of computer disposal.  Cited an EPA estimate that 45 million computers
      would become obsolete annually by 2005. California, Massachusetts and Minnesota
      have outlawed dumping computer equipment into landfills.  The only computer
      equipment currently considered hazardous waste are color monitors, which contain
      between 4 and 5 pounds of lead. \r\n\r\nThe article warns that a company could
      receive costly fines if equipment identified as theirs via serial numbers or
      tags is found illegally discarded in a landfill.  This could happen even if
      the equipment was donated or sent to a recycler.  The authors recommended that
      one always have the recipient sign a document accepting responsibility for equipment
      that has been donated or turned over for recycling.\r\n\r\nWhile the EPA has
      different requirements for organizations that dump different amounts of hazardous
      waste, the authors point out that an organization that disposes of 7 or 8 monitors
      in a given month would be liable for some of the EPA requirements.  The article
      also notes that EPA regulations only govern equipment disposed of in a landfill.
      \ The authors suggest three alternatives for disposing of end-of-life equipment:
      Donate, Recycle or Trade-In."

      Del Valle Independent School District and the Texas Water Commission. The dump
      was discoverd by the Texas Campaign for the Environment (TCE).  The director
      of the campaign stated that this was a perfect example of the problem caused
      by a lack of adequate computer recycling and disposal services.  In a follow-up
      article on December 19, 2003, the Del Valle ISD stated that despite the asset

    - EPA's Colleges and Universities Initiative
    - "Additional Author: Camille A. Corbin.\r\n\r\nThis newletter article provides
      a history and analysis of the EPA's Colleges and Universities Initiative.  I
      highlights some recent cases and suggests ways that colleges and universities
      can avoid fines by the EPA.  The article lists several practices that can lead
      to substantial fines.  These include:\r\n\r\n    *   improperly using and storing
      chemicals in laboratories, maintenance and sports facilities\r\n    * mismanaging
      medical wastes and art supplies\r\n    * stockpiling old computers and used
      fluorescent light bulbs\r\n    * allowing gasoline and heating oil to leak from
      bulk storage tanks\r\n    * failing to address asbestos, PCBs and lead paint
      in campus buildings\r\n    * operating water treatment facilities, generators,
      boilers and incinerators in violation of permit requirements disposing wastes
      improperly, and\r\n    * violating reporting regulations under RCRA, the Clean
      Air Act, the Clean Water Act, TSCA, EPCRA, and other federal and state environmental
      laws and regulations."

    - 'Audit: State left private information on discarded computers'
    - 'An audit of state agencies in Montanna revealed that they left private information
      on computers that were discarded.  Most of the computers were given to schools.  An
      audit team found private information on 12 of 18 computers that they recovered.  Information
      included: legal hearing notes, permit applications, e-mails from citizens etc.  Eight
      computers contained confidential information including social security numbers,
      financial records, job applicant information and information pertaining to technology
      security procedures.'

    - MIT researchers uncover mountains of private data on discard
    - This news release reports on the findings of two MIT graduate students who investigated
      the degree to which private records were retained on discarded or retired computer
      hard drives.  The students purchased 158 used disk drives for less than $1,000
      from e-Bay.  They found that only 12 drives were properly sanitized.  The researchers
      found over 5,000 credit card numbers, corporate financial records, medical records
      and gigabytes of personal e-mails.  The authors noted that some of the drives
      had been reformatted, but the information was still able to be retrieved.  Some
      of the original owners had simply deleted their documents, which was ineffectual.

    - 'The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the 21st Century'
    - "Friedman contends that the new information and communication technologies have
      leveled the playing field for emerging global economies such as China, Russia,
      India and those of Western Europe.  Friedman equates this \"leveling\" to the
      \"Flatening of the World\" where distance is elliminated and everyone can see,
      communicate and compete with everyone else.  The author suggests that while
      the flattening is a good thing, it also poses a considerable threat to the United
      States and other established powers in the world.\r\n\r\nEconomically, the threat
      is from competition from areas that have not been considered competitors in
      the past.  The most notable of these are India and China.  Friedman provides
      numerous examples of how these two countries have become major players in the
      world economy by providing services such as U.S. tax preparation, help desk
      support and other jobs made possible by the global, high-speed networks.  In
      2005, it is projected that 400,000 U.S. Tax returns will be completed in India.\r\n\r\nFriedman
      also points out that the flattening of the world has put many angry, frustrated
      and humiliated peoples in direct contact with the empowered long before either
      culture has had adequate time to prepare.  This has led to groups like al-Queda.
      \ Friedman notes that al-Queda has used the resources of the flat world, such
      as supply-chaining and work flow management, to become a highly efficient global
      organization.\r\n\r\nFacts and Statistics:  1. Smaller hospital are sending
      CAT scans abroad to be read over night. Radiologists know as \"Nighthawks.\"
      2. Military flies drones in Iraq piloted by experts at Nellis Air Force Base
      in Nevada while military personnel observe the \"real-time\" intelligence in
      Tampa, Qatar,  and the Pentagon. The military staff simultaneously conduct an
      online chat regarding the interpretation of what they are seeing. 3. Customers
      ordering food at the drive through window at McDonald's in Cape Girardeau, Missouri
      are actually talking to a call center in Colorado Springs, yet there is no way
      for them to know this, because their food is waiting when the pull up to the
      window. 4. By 2000, approximately 1.5 billion new workers entered the global
      labor force due to the collapse of the Soviet Empire, China's shift to capitalism
      and India's turn from Autarky. If 10 percent have the education and connectivity
      to compete the number, 150 million, equals the entire U.S. workforce. 5. There
      are more cell phones in China than there are people in the U.S. 6. December
      7, 2004, IBM announce that it was selling its Personal Computing Division to
      a Chinese company. 7. 2005 Budget NSF funding was cut by 1.9 percent. 8. Two-Thirds
      of the nation's math and science teachers will retire by 2010 (National Commission
      on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the Twenty-first Century. 8. Of 2.8
      million bachelor degrees in science and engineering granted worldwide in 2003,
      1.2 million - Asian students, 830,000 European and 400,000 in the U.S. In engineering,
      universities in Asia produce 8 times the number of Bachelor Degrees as the U.S.
      (National Science Board). 9. Federal funding for research in physical and mathematical
      sciences and egineering decreased by 37 percent between 1970 and 2004. 10. China
      is now the number 2 exporter to the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe Ten Flattners: 1. 11/9/89
      - The fall of the Berlin Wall opened up Eastern Europe to the Global Economy,
      2.    Netscape going public opened up the Internet to the masses, 3. Work Flow
      Software and shared standards allowed global communication and collaboration,
      4. Open sourcing enabled groups of people to design and develop powerful software
      applications independent of large corporations (bloggers-\"open source intelligence
      gatherers,\" 5. Y2K led to the need to outsource IT functions to India, which
      established it as a global IT leader, 6. Offshoring-companies moving operations
      to other countries not in search of low wage labor, but expertise, 7. Supply-Chaining-use
      of technology to create highly-efficient management of the supply chain led
      to \"Just in Time\" inventory control (WalMart), 8. Insourcing-UPS not only
      delivers supplies, but synchronizes supply chains for their customers and performs
      services on their behalf such as fixing Toshiba computers, 9. Informing-Google,
      Yahoo, MSN Web Search - making all of the world's knowledge available to anyone,
      anytime, anywhere. 10. The Steroides - Digital, Mobile, Personal, and Virtual-Friedman
      calls wireless the ubersteroid.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Covergence: Three things that
      came together to flatten the world.  First, the ten flatteners came together
      and began to work together. Second, businesses and individuals began to change
      the way they did things to utilize the 10 flatteners more effectively and finally,
      the addition of knowledge workers entering the global marketplace from China,
      India and the former Soviet Empire.\r\n\r\nThe IT revolution took time because
      people and businesses need to learn to do things differently. New ways of doing
      things made the IT resources more valuable. Businesses practices moved from
      a command and control model to a model of connecting and collaborating.\r\n\r\nMOST
      IMPORTANT MESSAGE: \"You have to constantly upgrade your skills.\"\r\n\r\nUntouchables
      = Workers whose jobs cannot be outsourced.  They fall into four categories:
      Workers who are special, specialized, anchored or really adaptable.  Anchored
      positions that rely on proximity to customers still may prove susceptible to
      outsourcing.\r\n\r\n\"HAVE WE BEEN INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE AND PREPARING OUR
      CHILDREN THE WAY WE NEED TO FOR THE RACE AHEAD?  THE ANSWER IS NO.\""

    - Blink
    - "Blink describes the role of the subconcious in decision making.  Gladwell provides
      examples of people who have developed a remarkable ability to sense patterns
      and key pieces of information subconciously that allow them to make highly accurate
      decisions and predictions. The book begins with a story about the purchase of
      an ancient sculpture being purchased by the Getty Museum.  The Museum conducted
      extensive research to establish its authenticity. After purchasing the work
      they invited experts to view it. Several were immediately repulsed by it and
      were sure that it was a fake based upon a \"feeling\" that they had. It turned
      out to be a fake. \r\n\r\nGladwell provided other examples of people who have
      developed a very high level of expertise that led to the ability to sense and
      understand the most critical information without being distracted by extraneous
      data. One such person was Brendan Reilley who headed Cook County Hospital's
      Department of Medicine. Reilley conducted a study to determine the most basic
      and critical factors in diagnosing when someone was having, or about to have
      a heart attack. This saved a great deal of money in needless diagnostics and
      monitoring. He was initially criticized because the doctors involved felt that
      diagnosis required many tests and much data. By reducing the amount of information
      to just a few critical factors, Gladwell actually increased the accuracy of
      the physicians' diagnoses. \r\n\r\nAnother example of how an over reliance on
      data can prove counter productive was illustrated by a war game where the blue
      team had sophisticated intelligence collecting technologies. The red team had
      an experienced commander who relied on his instincts and those of is officers
      to conduct the battle. The latter won handily.\r\n\r\nThe above two examples
      illustrate the danger of today's reliance on data over human logic and judgement.
      It suggests that the emphasis given to Data Driven Decision Making and Empirical
      Studies to guide educational decisions may carry some risk.\r\n\r\nJohn Gottman
      developed the ability to determine with uncanny accuracy whether a marriage
      would last based upon observing a short conversation between spouses.  He developed
      a sensitivity to unspoken messages that had a very high correlation with the
      sustainability of the marriage.  The unspoken messages via expressions or word
      choice tended to reveal the level of respect or contempt that one person had
      for the other.\r\n\r\nA very important issue discussed in the book is the influence
      of subliminal predispositions or predjudices.  One striking example was the
      impact that having to reveal their race had on African American college students
      when taking a sample GRE.  When asked to identify their race on a pretest questionnaire,
      the number of answers that the students got right was cut in half. Gladwell
      provided several other examples of how subliminal messages, sometimes simply
      presented as barely distinguishable word patterns, can influence a person's
      behavior. He termed this effect, \"Priming.\" One such example involved Warren
      Harding who was elected president because he \"looked like\" the quintessential
      leader, tall and handsome. Unfortunately, he was anything but a strong leader.
      Thus, priming lead to very negative outcomes."

    - Fostering Historical Thinking With Digitized Sources
    - "ADDITIONAL AUTHOR: LAUREN B. GOLDENBERG\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study examined two
      research questions: 1. How do students describe\r\ntheir current history or
      social studies class (given that it was taught\r\nby a teacher trained to use
      primary documents)? Sub-questions include:\r\nDo they see it as different from
      prior history/social studies classes?\r\nand, do students, according to their
      self-reports, learn more history,\r\nand like histroy more, as a result of their
      current class?  2. What\r\nhistorical thinking skills do these students exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe
      study included five classrooms that varied in several ways. Three\r\nwere history
      classes, one was an English class and one was a geography\r\nclass. Two were
      middle school classrooms and three were high school\r\nclasses. One was an AP/Honors
      class, three were regular English or\r\nhistory classes and one history class
      was for low-achieving students.\r\n\r\nThe research study used a set of tools
      created specifically for this\r\nstudy. These tools were designed to 1. support
      and scaffold image-based\r\nhistory learning in the online environment; and
      2. make visible and\r\ncomparable the thinking processes of students, teachers
      and historians\r\nas they interpret documents.  The tools can be found at Picturing\r\nModern
      America (http://www.edc.org/CCT/PMA/).\r\n\r\nIn response to question 1, sixty-eight
      percent of the students said\r\nthat their current class was different than
      previous history classes\r\nthat they had taken in the past. The reasons that
      they gave were: 1.\r\n\"Using technology to learn in new ways,\" 2. \"Working
      with primary\r\nsources to gain a deeper understanding,\" 3. \"Learning independently,
      as\r\nwell as in small groups.\" While almost all of the students said that\r\ntheir
      current class required more work, the majority said that they\r\nenjoyed it
      more.\r\n\r\nWith regard to research question 2, the students did exhibit the
      use of\r\nhistorical thinking behaviors (observation, sources, inferencing,\r\nevidence,
      question posing, and corroboration). While the students in\r\nthe AP/Honors
      class exhibited these behaviors to the greates degree,\r\nall of the participating
      students, including those deemed \"remedial\"\r\ndisplayed good historical thinking.\r\n\r\nConclusions:
      1. Students can apply historical thinking behaviors when\r\nconfronted with
      a primary resource regardless of whether they are\r\nfamiliar with the background
      and time period. 2. Students feel more invested when they have structured time
      to construct meaning using primary materials and analyzing their meaning.\r\n\r\nWhen
      teachers use primary sources to actively engage their students, students learn
      to historical interpretation and document analysis.  \r\n\r\nTeachers need to
      receive increased professional development in the use of primary digital sources,
      specifically in the the skill necessary to analyze documents and images.  The
      use of software programs to scaffold these processes can be valuable."

    - A Briefer History of Time
    - "A Briefer History of Time is a follow-up to Hawking's earlier book \"A History
      of Time.\"  Hawkings indicated that he wrote the book in response to requests
      from readers of his first volume.  The book has beautiful illustrations of the
      various concepts presented.  Hawking's reviews the early cosmological theories
      and theories of the universe including those of: Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus,
      Galileo and Newton.  He devotes considerable attention to Einstein's Theory
      of Relativity, which led to the conclusion that space and time are aspects of
      the same concept \"SpaceTime.\"  He provided numerous examples of how space
      and time are relative and that time can be altered both forward and backward
      as one approaches the speed of light.  He also discussed the impact of gravity
      on SpaceTime using the \"Twins Paradox\" to illustrate how even a person's biological
      clock is not absolute.\r\n\r\nHawkings noted that Quantum Theory had answered
      many questions that traditional Physics failed to answer.  He pointed out, however,
      that the laws governing Quantum Mechanics actually differed from those of traditional
      Physics and this created a problem for Physicists trying to explain the formation
      of the universe and the laws that govern it.  The fundamental principle of Quantum
      Theory is the \"Uncertainty Principle.\" This states that one cannot determine
      with equal accuracy both the position and velocity of a given particle. In order
      to identify the position of the particle with great accuracy, one would need
      to hit it with a Photon, which would significantly alter its velocity.  \r\n\r\nThe
      ultimate goal of Physicists is to develop a unified theory that consistently
      applies to all matter both at the Quantum scale and at the observable scale.\r\n\r\nHawkings
      explained the how cosmologists have determined that the Universe is expanding
      at an increasing rate by analyzing the Blackbody Radiation.  This indicated
      that all of the galaxies were moving away from us.  While this could support
      the idea that we are at the center of the Universe, scientists then realized
      that galaxies were all moving away from each other.  Hawkings states that the
      Universe will continue to expand at an ever-increasing rate and that time will
      go on forever.\r\n\r\nOur sun is eight lightminutes away.\r\n\r\nHawkings discusses
      Wormholes and the possibility of time travel, which he considers \"just a matter
      of engineering.\"  Hawkings used a story of a traveler between the earth and
      Proxima Centauri in 2012 to illustrate how the traveler could use a wormhole
      to travel forward and backward in time.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, Hawkings
      discusses whether God played a role in the formation of the Universe.  Initially,
      he states that such a question should not be addressed by science because it
      would have occured before the big bang and could not be observed or known.  At
      another point he states that space-time may have had no actual \"boundary condition\"
      and, therefore, there is not need to appeal to God for an answer.  Later, he
      expresses amazement at how finely adjusted the values of particles such as the
      charge of the electron had to be to allow the formation of life. Hawkings states
      at another point, \"Actually, the idea that God might want to change His mind
      is an example of the fallacy, pointed out by St. Augustine, of imagining God
      as a being exiting in time.  Time is a property only of the universe that God
      created.  Presumably, He knew what He intended when He set it up!\"  \r\n\r\nHawkings
      concludes the book by saying that there is a good chance that physicists will
      discover a unified theory within a lifetime.  He notes, however, that this will
      not be the end.  That scientists, or philosophers will need to examine the question
      \"Why?\"  He suggests that this important question has been subjugated to the
      question of \"How?\"  Hawkings states, \"Is the unified theory so compelling
      that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and if so,
      does He have any other effect on the universe?  And who created Him?\r\n\r\nThe
      book includes short biographies of Einstein, Gallileo and Newton."

    - 'Virtual Software: The Future for Schools'
    - This article discusses the emerging trend of software virtualization services
      (SVS) that promises to revolutionalize and simplify the technology management
      in the schools.  This service would operate similar to a server client model,
      but would be completely OS independent.  It would simplify IT support, because
      it would obviate the need to support individual machines and would eliminate
      threats posed by viruses permeating the network and infecting individual machines.  The
      author notes that a move to such a paradigm would necessitate an overhaul of
      the current software licensing practices and would probably move software companies
      to offer their products on a subscription basis.  He likens this potentially
      disruptive technology to the introduction of the steam engin, which set off
      the Industrial Revolution.

    - The Literacy of America's College Students
    - "The research cited in this report was conducted by the American Institutes
      for Research and funded by the Pew Trust.  The actual study was entitled the
      National Survey of America's College Student (NSACS) and used the same tool,
      the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, used in an earlier study of adult
      literacy conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\r\n\r\nThe
      study examined three types of literacy: Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and
      Quantitative Literacy.  Prose Literacy examined the ability to find and evaluate
      information from continuous text.  Document Literacy refered to the ability
      to search, comprehend and use information from non-continuous text such as forms.
      \ Quantitative Literacy referred to the ability to perform calculations and
      other quantitative tasks using numbers embedded in text.\r\n\r\nThe study compared
      the document literacy of students in their final year of two and four years
      colleges to the general adult population, adults who had achieved similar academic
      levels and several other characteristics such as course of study, future educational
      plans, native language etc. The study used a rubric to classify students' literacy
      levels as Below Basic, Basic, Intermediate, or Proficient.\r\n\r\nPrimary Finding:
      1.The average Pose, Document and Quantitative Literacy of students in 2 and
      4 year colleges was higher than the general adult population.  2. Thirty percent
      of students in two-year colleges and twenty percent of students in four-year
      colleges achieved only a basic level in Quantitative Literacy.  3.  There is
      no literacy gap between male and female students in two or four year institutions.
      \ This is different than the findings in the general population. 4.  There is
      a significant literacy gap between whites and minorities.  5. Students in four-year
      colleges had higher average literacy rates than did students in two-year colleges.
      \ 6.  There was no significant difference in the average literacy rates for
      students in private vs. public four-year institutions. 7.  Prose Literacy was
      higher for students in selective colleges vs. non-selective schools.  8.  Literacy
      rates did not differ for students in two-year schools regardless of academic
      vs. technical orientation.  9. Literacy of U.S. born students was higher than
      peers born in foreign countries.  10.  There was a positive correlation between
      income and Prose and Docment Literacy. 11.  There was a positive correlation
      between Literacy and level of parents level of education.  12. Students who
      graduated from U.S. high schools had higher literacy rates than students who
      graduated from foreign high schools.  12.  Length of time to complete degree
      did not effect literacy.  13.  Students in two-year colleges who took remediate
      math had lower Quantitative Literacy, but students who took remedial English
      had lower literacy scores in all domains.  14.  Average Literacy did not differ
      across majors except for Education and Business majors.  15. There was a positive
      correlation between GPA and Literacy.  16.  Average literacy rates were higher
      for students expecting to earn their first professional degree.  18.  Prose
      and Document Literacy were highest for students who had taken courses that required
      analytic thinking.  19.  math, science, and engineering majors, had higher average
      literacy than business majors across the literacy scales. The document and quantitative
      literacy of math, science, and engineering majors was also higher than the document
      and quantitative literacy of education majors."

    - 'Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age'
    - "Watts examines the social and physical networks that connect the world.  He
      bases his title and the essential question of this book on the concept of six
      degrees of separation between any two people on the earth.  This concept originated
      in the \"Small World\" experiment by Milgram who found that it generally took
      six acquaintenaces to get a letter  between two strangers in geographic disparate
      locations.\r\n\r\nWatts examined the way social networks evolve. He and a partner
      also attempted to replicate Milgram's small world experiment on a large scale
      using the Internet. He found that replicating the experiment to be difficult.\r\n\r\nThe
      Author discusses how social networks form and the impact that they have on the
      spread of information and even disease. He notes that random affiliation networks
      form because of what people do, but that networks can also influence what people
      do. \r\n\r\nWatts discusses how social networks enable the spread of disease
      and demonstrates that this functions very closely to how computer viruses spread
      throughout a network.\r\n\r\nInformation Cascade: Individuals in a population
      stop acting as individuals and begin acting like a coherent mass.  People do
      things because others do them; they say things because others say them etc.
      \ This leads to highly ambiguous and often misinterpreted cause and effect relationships.\r\n\r\nIn
      a highly networked environment, small events can trigger disproportiontly large
      reactions. Yet, large events may be absorbed relatively easily."

    - Einstein and Religion
    - "Jammer analyzes Einstein's perspective on religion. The author also examines
      the impact that Einstein's theory of relativity has had on theological thought.\r\n\r\nIn
      Eistein's early years, he received instruction both in Judeism and Catholicism.
      Although he initially seemed to internalize traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs,
      he eventually rejected the concept of a personal God.  Deeply influenced by
      Spinoza, he developed a belief that he referred to as \"Cosmic Religion.\"  Cosmic
      Religion viewed God as the creator of the laws that govern the universe. It
      was a deterministic theology that rejected the concept of free will and that
      of an anthropomorphic God.\r\n\r\nEinstein's Credo stated, \"The most beautiful
      experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which
      stands at the cradle of true art and true science...it is this emotion that
      constitutes true religiosity; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply
      religious man.\"\r\n\r\nEinstein saw God as manifest in the universe. He stated,
      \"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.\""

    - Decoding The Universe
    - "Seife examines how Information Theory governs the Universe. The premise of
      the book is that everything in the universe contains information that is constantly
      being exchanged.  This information exchange results in changes both on the micro
      and macroscopic level.\r\n\r\nThe book begins with a discussion of how the ability
      to encrypt and decrypt information changed the world at various times.  Seife
      discusses decryption techniques and the importance of looking for redundancies
      in the decyption process.\r\n\r\nSeife reviews many of the concepts associated
      with classical and quantum pysics such as entropy, superposition, entaglement
      and Heizenberg's Uncertainty Principle, entaglement and collapse etc. Particles
      in \"superposition\" maintain two diametrically opposed states simultaneously.
      This phenomenon has been empirically demonstrated using single photon particles
      in double slit experiments. Quantum mechanics, however, states that once the
      particles are observed, they randomly choose a particular state.  Entanglement
      occurs when two particles in distant locations (even different segments of the
      universe) mirror each other. Heizenberg's Uncertainty principle states that
      as information about one complementary observable increases, information about
      the other observable decreases. An example would be, as the measurement of a
      particles momentum becomes more precise, information regarding its exact location
      becomes less accurate.  All of these phenomena are information dependent. Superposition
      collapses when the object is observed. Because objects are constantly collecting
      and distributing information, the collapse does not require observation by a
      human. A photon striking the object from a distant star represents an observation.\r\n\r\nSeif
      points out that the objects throughout the universe are currently exchanging
      information. As particles of light bounce off of an object information regarding
      the object's composition, size and location may be surmized. Organic bodies
      contain huge amounts of information such as DNA.  Seife makes the interesting
      observation that humans have actually achieved immortality through the genetic
      information contained within their cells. Seif gives the example of a thousand
      year old skeleton. When its DNA was analyzed it was found to be almost identical
      to teacher in one of the local schools. While the container of the information
      had died, the information itself continued to be viable.\r\n\r\nSeif demonstrates
      that information, including the DNA described above can be expressed in binary
      form (off/on; dead/alive; spin up/spin down). He discusses how scientists are
      working to develop a practical quantum computer that would ultimately be more
      powerful than any of the computers today. Quantum information is not time bound;
      there is no before and after. There is no sender and receiver. Because of its
      unique properties, quantum information is more robust, making the quantum computer
      potentially far more powerful than the computers of today."

    - The Revenge of Gaia
    - "James Lovelock is a noted scientist and author in the area of climate and climate
      change. He developed the Gaia Hypothesis, which has become the Gaia Theory.
      The Gaia Theory holds that the Earth functions like a self-regulating body whose
      systems adapt to sustain an environment supportive of life.  While the Gaia
      Theory has been viewed critically by some scientists, it has grown in stature
      and has been accepted by most scientists today.\r\n\r\nThe full title of this
      book is: The Revenge of Gaia: Earth's Climate Crisis & The Fate of Humanity.
      Lovelock likens the Earth to a sick patient that has developed a fever. The
      fever has been caused by actions by man that have simultaneously increased the
      production of carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse Gases and reduced the Earth's
      ability to absorb carbon dioxide by reducing the amount of algea, trees and
      other vegetation on the earth.  In addition, Lovelock notes that the sun has
      become hotter since life began almost four billion years ago. Scientists estimate
      that the temperature of the sun, like other stars, has increased by around 25
      percent.\r\n\r\nThe problem has been exacerbated by the cutting down of the
      forests and the development of much of the land for farms, houses and concrete.
      \ Lovelock also explains that as the surface temperature of the oceans heats
      up in the sun, the water expands and forms two layers that do not mix. The top
      layer (which currently comprises 80% of the oceans) eventually becomes a virtual
      desert with little life. Ironically, he explains, this is why the water in the
      tropical climates is so blue, because little life exists in its upper layers.
      \ Farming also eliminates trees necessary for \"pumping down\" carbon dioxide,
      while creating more greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nLovelock does not consider himself
      \"Green,\" and is actually viewed critically by many of these groups.  One reason
      is that he does not believe that current plans for \"sustainable\" energy provide
      a solution to the problem.  He does not believe that these solutions are practical
      and, in some cases, may actually make the situation worse.  Lovelock believes
      that the only reasonable short-term solution is Nuclear Power.  He suggests
      that the waste from nuclear power plants poses much lower risk to mankind and
      the environment that does the continuation of global warming.\r\n\r\nLovelock
      states that climatologists today believe that the earth may be extremely close
      to irreversible damage to the Earth's atmosphere that will result in rendering
      the planet largely uninhabitable within the century. At this point, the Earth
      will unable to recover and regain the capacity to regulate itself do to a process,
      which he calls \"Positive Feedback.\"  In this situation, the impact of global
      warming perpetuates and intensifies future global warming.  An example of this
      would be the melting of the ice fields in Greenland and the Polar regions that
      has already begun. One of the ways that the Earth remains cool enough to sustain
      life is through the reflection of sunlight and heat by the ice.  As the ice
      melts, the heat is absorbed, thus increasing overall temperature of the planet."

    - Programming the Universe
    - "Seth Lloyd is a professor of Quantum-Mechanical Engineering at MIT.  He is
      credited with the design of the first feasible quantum computer. Lloyd contends
      that the universe represents the first information processor. He states that
      every particle and every atom contains information that it transmits and receives
      through collisions on the microscopic scale and through momentous events on
      the macroscopic scale. This is consistent with the science of Information Theory
      as described by Charles Seif (also summarized in this database).\r\n\r\nLloyd
      describes how the information theory pertains to the formation and evolution
      of the universe. He explains that the second law of Thermodynamics states that
      entropy can never decrease.  According to the Law of Thermodynamics, entropy
      represents heat energy that cannot be converted to mechanical energy and used
      to produce work. According to Information Theory, entropy also represents the
      information that is contained in a particle that cannot be known. These unknown
      bits of information interact, however, with known bits of information and can
      change them.  Lloyd states that as energy changes state through the interaction
      of atoms and particles, they operate as logical gates similar to those found
      on logic boards in computers.\r\n\r\nOn the quantum scale, however, particles
      have properties not found at the macroscopic scale. Properties such as \"superpositioning\"
      (a particle can maintain two opposite states simultaneously or be in two places
      simultaneously) and \"entaglement\" (the behavior of one particle influencing
      the behavior of a distant particle without any apparent communication or attachment)
      offer tremendously increased computing power. Lloyd noted that this computing
      power enabled the formation of the universe and can be harnessed to drive quantum
      computers in the future. The property of \"superpositioning\" allows quantum
      bit, or \"qbits'\" to register both a 1 and a 0 simultaneousl.  Thus, a quantum
      computer can conduct to computations simultaneously. This ability has been termed
      \"Quantum Parallelism\" by David Deutch. This ability contrasts to classical
      computers in that classical parellel computers link several processors together
      to conduct simultaneous processing. The Quantum Computer can perform several
      computations simultaneously using a single processor. Lloyd compares a classical
      computer to a solo voice and a quantum computer to a symphony. \r\n\r\nLloyd
      state, \"since the universe registers and processes information like a quantum
      computer and is observationally indistinguishable from a quantum computer, then
      it is a quantum computer.\"  He concludes that one should think of the universe,
      \"not simply as a machine, but as a machine that processes information.\""

    - Three Billion New Capitalists
    - "Clyde Prestowitz is president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington,
      D.C.  He also served as a counselor to the Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan
      Administration.\r\n\r\nPresotwitz identifies three waves of globalization. The
      first wave spanned the period from 1415-1914. This wave began with India and
      China dominating the world economy. This was disrupted when the Portuguese decided
      to go around land routes used for commerce and controlled by the Arabs by building
      fast, ships called Caravels. These ships were primarily designed to carry information
      between the ports and represented the first Information Technology, according
      to Prestowitz. This use of technology to spur the global economy rapidly shifted
      economic power to the West. The Industrial Revolution then increased this dominance
      and further developed the global economy. The first and second world wars, however,
      brought this first wave of globalization to an end.\r\n\r\nThe second wave of
      globalization occurred between 1947 and 2000. This wave of globalization was
      dominated by the United States. The US and its allies negotiated trade agreements
      and treaties that eventually led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization.
      The primary currency of the second wave of globalization shifted from gold to
      the dollar. During this time period, the US experienced a trade deficit, which
      US policy makers did not view as particularly troublesome. The administration
      felt that the free market forces would prevail and adopted a \"hands off\" policy.
      Market share for manufactured goods shifted to Japan, but the US economy continued
      to grow due to a shift to a services rather than manufactured products. This
      continued until the dot com bust. This also had a negative impact on the Japanese
      economy.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the third wave of globalization has seen China and
      India, once again returning as centers of economic power. This has been made
      possible primarily through the advances in Information and Communication Technologies
      (ICT). Manufacturing in the US has fallen from 23% of the GDP to 12.7%.  Meanwhile,
      India and China have invested heavily to educate their youth in critical areas
      such as engineering, mathematics and technology. Competitions for US citizens
      in this new global economy has been exacerbated by the introduction of \"Three
      billion new capitalists\" from China, India and the countries that comprised
      the former Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nPrestowitz identifies several concerns that
      do not bode well for US competitiveness in the future. Several of which Tom
      Friedman also highlighted in his book, The Earth is Flat. One concern is motivation.
      Speaking of the three billion new capitalists Prestowitz states, \"They are
      not thinking about thirty-five-hour work weeks or whether the value of a Ph.D.
      in computer science is worth the effort. For them anything less than eighty
      hours a week is a vacation, and not getting the Ph.D. constitutes a devastating
      setback.\" Another area of concern is the low rate of savings among Americans.
      Prestowitz notes that China has one of the highest savings rates at over 40%
      of GDP. Immigration restrictions enacted following the September 11th attack
      also threaten to reduce US competitiveness. Talented students from other countries
      such as India previously would study at universities in the US and then would
      stay to build careers. This trend has decreased and this has led to an increase
      in outsourcing.\r\nAs did Friedman, Prestowitz cites statistics showing that
      India and China are producing many more highly qualified engineers and scientists
      than the United States and that they will enter the job market at rates that
      US graduates would not consider. This, too, threatens to take business away
      from the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest concerns that Prestowitz
      highlights is the lack of investment and/or engagement of recent US administrations
      in the development of new industries and technologies. He points out that RCA
      was established by Woodrow Wilson through strategic navy contracts because he
      recognized the importance of being a leader in radio communications. This was
      also how the US established dominance in the aerospace and telecommunications
      industries. Today, much of the manufacturing done in these industries is outsourced
      to other countries. Prestowitz states, \"Today the nation that once sent men
      to the moon on the mighty Apllo rockets launches its satellites on Russian,
      Chinese, and European rockets.\r\n\r\nPrestowitz expresses concern regarding
      the US commitment to R&D, pointing out that as manufacturing leaves the US,
      it negatively impacts US R&D. Manufacturing plays a critical role in this process
      producing prototypes and models. Without that capability, research is greatly
      hampered.\r\n\r\nPrestowitz concludes stating that the US overall productivity
      is the highest, it is the leader in technology, it has the finest universities
      in the world and it spends far more on R & D than any other nation. He then
      suggests that we are squandering this strong hand by playing our \"card\" poorly.
      He notes that the US is building a huge debt that is not being used to invest
      in our infrastructure or workforce, our students do not compare well to others
      around the world, we are not investing in the physical sciences and we have
      squandered much of the respect that the US has enjoyed by other nations around
      the world.  He states, \"The first priority of American leaders-even more important
      than fighting terror or spreading liberty-should be to ensure long-term US competitiveness.\""

    - The Meaning of the 21st Century
    - "James Martin is the founder of the James Martin 21st Century School at Oxford
      University.  According to Marting, the mission of the school is, \"to identify
      and find solutions to the biggest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century,
      and to find the biggest opportunities.\"  Martin began his career as a rocket
      scientist.  He then joined the IBM Systems Research Institute.  Eventually,
      he started his own consulting firm for dealing with complex problems and spent
      25 years consulting for some of the major political and business leaders of
      the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe Meaning of the 21st Century identifies challenges
      that humans will face during the next 100 years.  For the first time in history,
      some of these challenges threaten the continued existence of the human race.
      \ Martin refers to these as \"existential\" challenges.  Some of these include:
      Global Warming; the proliferation of nuclear weapons; environmental degradation
      including the distruction of fisheries; extreme poverty juxtaposed with oppulent
      wealth and unbridled scientific experimentation.  \r\n\r\nWhile the challenges
      of the 21st century pose greater threats than at any time in the past, Martin
      also describes it as the most exciting time to be alive.  He goes on to describe
      how breakthroughs in science, medicine and technology hold the key to the greatest
      and most rapid advancement of the human race.  Some of these include: the development
      of non-human intelligence in machines; artificial intelligence, genetic engineering,
      nanotechnology; and incredible advances in information and communication technologies.
      \ Martin contends that these advances can actually serve as tools to meet the
      challenges of the 21st century and catapult humankind to a whole new level of
      evolution.  In fact, he suggests that the 21st century marks the first time
      that homo sapiens, or any species, has actually had the ability to control its
      own evolution.\r\n\r\nMartin uses the metaphor of a trip through a canyon to
      represent the 21st century.  As mankind moves towards mid-century, the water
      (challenges), will become more turbulent, fast and threatening.  If mankind
      is capable of navigating these turbulent times, he/she will emerge stronger
      and begin the climb to greater elevations (achievements)."

    - Tough Choices or Tough Times
    - "This is an executive summary of the full report released in mid-December 2006.
      The report summarizes the findings and recommendations of a blue ribbon commission
      comprised of leading educators, business persons and policy-makers.  This is
      actually the second Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce.  The
      first commission, which conducted its study in the early 1990's concluded that
      low-skill jobs were going over to countries with low wages.  The commission
      concluded that the US would be wise to abandon competing for those jobs and
      concentrate on high-value-added jobs and services.  This would require that
      the US adopt the highest educational standards for its citizens.  The commission
      did not anticipate that low-wage countries would produce highly-educated workers
      that would be able to deliver high-quality, high-skill work at low cost.\r\n\r\nThe
      commission notes that US students have fallen to the middle of the pack on the
      three major international educational assessments.  Thirty years ago, thirty-percent
      of the college graduates came from the US.  That number has decreased to 16%.\r\n\r\nThe
      commission asks,if students in the US attain a very high-level of education
      in science and mathematics that equals to education and skills of the engineers
      from China and India, why would employers pay the high wages in the US for the
      same quality of work that can be acquired from China and India at a fraction
      of the cost.  They state that this could only be possible if they can get something
      from US workers that they cannot get from foreign workers.\r\n\r\n\"Creativity
      and innovation are the key to the good life.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission notes that
      the current education system was designed for a different age when a rudimentary
      education was sufficient.  They state that the current education system cannot
      be patched to meet the needs of today's students.  The education system must
      be changed.\r\n\r\nStep #1: Assume that we will do the job right the first time.
      \ The commission recommends a series of Board Exams that qualify students to
      advance within the educational system.  This is similar to some of the board
      exams required in European countries.  Students would be eligible to retake
      the exams throughout their lives on an unlimited basis.\r\n\r\nStep #2:  Make
      much more efficient use of available resources.  Recruit teachers from the top
      third of the students going on to college.  Build a high-quality pre-school
      program.  Give the nation's disadvantaged students the resources they need to
      succeed.\r\n\r\nStep #3: Recruit from the top third of the nation's high school
      students who are going to college.  Revamp the compensation system to bring
      pensions and other retirement benefits in line with top corporation.  Then take
      the savings and put them into wages to make teaching more attractive to younger
      teachers.  Teachers would be paid directly by the state.\r\n\r\nStep #4: Develop
      standards, assessments, and curriculum that reflect today's needs and tomorrow's
      requirements.  Assessments must be developed that not only test what students
      know in core curricular areas, but must test skills needed to be successful
      in the 21st Century: creativity and innovation, facility with the use of ideas
      and abstractions,self-discipline and organization, and the ability to work in
      with a team.\r\n\r\nStep #5: Create high-performance schools and districts everywhere.
      \ The school district would not be responsible for running the schools, but
      rather for hiring contractors and monitoring performance.  The contract school
      would be a public school and teachers would be paid directly by the state.  Every
      school would have to be associated with a \"helping institution.\"  This could
      be the school district, a cooperative of teachers, a teacher preparation institution
      etc.\r\n\r\nStep #6: Provide high-quality, universal early childhood education.\r\n\r\nStep
      #7: Give strong support to the students who need it most.  Saving should make
      it possible to keep school buildings open for extended periods of time.  Funds
      should also be available to provide tutoring and therapies.  The emphasis on
      recruitment of top-level teachers should enable schools to provide teachers
      who look like their students and can provide inspiration and understanding.\r\n\r\nStep
      #8: Enable every member of the adult workforce to get the new literacy skills.
      \ Provide education and training that will enable adult workers to acquire the
      knowledge and skills necessary to pass the Board Exam that most will pass by
      age 16.\r\n\r\nStep #9: Create \"Personal Competitiveness Accounts.\"  The government
      would create the accounts with a $500 investment for every child born.  Parents,
      employers and the individual may continue to invest tax free.  The money would
      then be used for any work-related education or training that would make the
      individual more competitive.\r\n\r\nStep #10: Create regional Competitivenes
      Authorities to make America competitive.  These would work on regional economic
      development and would coordinate the education and training institutions efforts
      to achieve the goals set."

    - Sixteen Trends:Their Profound Impact on Our Future
    - "Gary Marx is the President of the Center for Public Outreach.  He has held
      a variety of high-level position in education, including a 20 year career as
      an excutive in the communications department of the American Association of
      School Administrators.\r\n\r\nAs the title implies, Marx identifies sixteen
      trends that he feels will have a major impact on both the United States and
      the world.  He identified these trends via two surveys distributed to the \"Creating
      A Future Council of Advisors.  He then posits implications for education and
      suggests actions that schools and educators might take to best prepare students
      for the future.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen trends include: \r\n\r\n1. For the first
      time in history, the old will outnumber the young. This is true among the developed
      nations of the world.  The converse is true among the underdeveloped nations.\r\n2.
      Majorities will become minorities.\r\n3. Social and intellectual capital will
      become economic drivers, intensifying competition for well-educated people.\r\n4.
      Technology will increase the speed of communication and the pace of advancement
      or decline (Macro->Micro->Nano->Subatomic).\r\n5. The Millennial Generation
      will insist on solutions to accumulated problems and injustices, whilean emerging
      Generation E will call for equilibrium.\r\n6. Standards and high-stakes tests
      will fuel a demand for personalization in an education system increasingly committed
      to lifelong human development.\r\n7. Release of human ingenuity will become
      a primary responsibility of education and society.\r\n8. Continuous improvement
      will replace quick fixes and defense of the status quo.\r\n9. Scientific discoveries
      and societal realities will force widespread ethical choices.\r\n10. Common
      opportunities and threats will intensify a worldwide demand for planetary security.\r\n11.
      Polarization and narrowness will bend toward reasoned discussion, evidence,
      and consideration of varying points of view.\r\n12. International learning,
      including diplomatic skills, will become basic, as nations vie for understanding
      and respect in an interdependent world.\r\n13. Greater numbers of people will
      seek personal meaning in their lives in response to an intennse, high-tech,
      alway-on, fast-moving society.\r\n14. Understanding will grow that sustained
      poverty is expensive, debilitating, and unsettling.\r\n15. Pressure will grow
      for society to prepare people for jobs and careers that may not currently exist.\r\n16.
      Competition will increase to attract and keep qualified educators.\r\n\r\nOther
      Observations include:\r\n\r\n1. To be successful, students need a grounding
      in the histories, cultures, people and languages of the world.\r\n2. Distance
      learning is no longer an innovation.  Virtual Reality should be considered for
      instruction.\r\n3. At the end of the class, the world will have gotten smarter
      than when the class got under way.  Students will pool what they've learned
      in class, their life experience, and their insights, as they create new knowledge
      and engage in breakthrough thinking.\r\n4. Unless we are committed to a constant
      process of creating a future, others will creat a future for us...\r\n5. See
      Millennial Ecosystem Assessment.\r\n6. Students who leave school without some
      grounding in international education may turn out to be the new disadvantaged.\r\n7.
      By 2015 more than half of us will be working at jobs that don't exist yet.\r\n8.
      At the turn of the 21st Century, Knowledge Workers made up 30% of the US workforce,
      but commanded 50% of all wages and salaries."

    - China, Inc.
    - "Ted Fishman has written essays and reports for many leading national publications.
      \ He also has worked as a floor trader and CEO of his own trading firm.\r\n\r\nChina,
      Inc. chronicles the rapid move towards capitalism by the Republic of China.
      \ Fishman paints a vivid picture of modern day China as it juxtaposes capitalism
      upon its communistic ideology. He describes a nation characterized by vast poverty
      in rural areas and rapid growth and entrepreneurialism in the cities.\r\n\r\nFishman
      describes how \"Eighteen Farmers Saved China.\"  The farmers, secretly and illegally,
      agreed to divvy up the collective on which they worked.  They would continue
      to pay the mandated grain tax to the government, but would be allowed to keep
      any profit that they could produce from their portion of the land.  The farmers
      saw an immediate improvement in their income and their lives.  The government,
      when it became aware of this, chose to turn the other way.  This story has grown
      to the point of mythology in China.\r\n\r\nThe success of the farmers encouraged
      other impoverished residents of the countryside to begin their own small businesses;
      selling wares in the cities.  Some of these business have grown dramatically
      in a relatively short period of time.  This has also resulted in a mass migration
      to the cities.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly expanding Chinese economy has had a tremendous
      global impact.  Corporation rush to establish themselves in China seeing its
      1.3 billion inhabitants as an lucrative new market.  The Chinese government
      has capitalized on this by requiring corporations wishing to do business in
      China to partner with Chinese companies. In so doing, it has provided Chinese
      companies access to extremely valuable intellectual property.  Since China provides
      little protection for property rights, Chinese companies have taken this knowledge
      and used it to develop competing product domestically.  Fishman offers the example
      involving GM.  The Chinese car company that partnered with GM manufactured a
      clone of one of the GM cars and sold it as their own.\r\n\r\nFishman also devotes
      a considerable amount of the book to the impact of software piracy by China.
      \ He notes that one can buy a Chinese computer packed with the latest software
      for a fraction of the global market value.  All of the software is pirated and
      all of it works extremely well.  When software manufacturers such as Microsoft
      protest that this is stealing billions of dollars, the Chinese government points
      out that no one in China could afford the exorbitant prices of the software
      if it was not pirated, so Microsoft actually is not losing anything.\r\n\r\nThe
      greatest threat to the economies of other developed countries, Fishman points
      out, is the cheap cost of labor in China. Because of the huge workforce and
      rampant poverty, China's human resources allow companies to manufacture goods
      at a fraction of the cost that developed nations encounter.  This has led corporations
      to outsource much of their manufacturing to China where the quality is as good
      or better than the US, Japan or Europe.  Fishman points out that China's piracy
      of intellectual property also contributes to their low overhead.  The Chinese,
      as well as some economic advisers in the US, suggest that the loss of low-skill
      jobs to China should not hurt the US economy, but move it towards a focus on
      innovation.  Fishman points out that research and development requires easy
      access to the means of production to be successful and that the loss of manufacturing
      promises to adversely effect innovation.  This was also pointed out by James
      Martin in The Meaning of the 21st Century.\r\n\r\nChina's impact on the US economy
      is significant for several reasons.  Because China pegs the yauan to the US
      dollar.  This results in Chinese goods always being cheaper than similar US
      goods and has led to a substantial trade deficit.  This has strained relations
      between the US and China.  China has also become the major lender to the US
      by purchasing bonds.  It has accrued enough US dollars over the years to actually
      impact the value of the dollar, should it choose to \"flood the market\" with
      US currency.\r\n\r\nFishman addresses the problems of corruption and pollution
      that plague China.  In the end, though, he speaks with admiration for the accomplishments
      of the nation and predicts that its success and influence will continue to grow."

    - Cell of Cells
    - "Cell of Cells is a comprehensive look at the state of stem cell research throughout
      the world.  Fox reports on research being conducted in Israel, South Korea,
      China, Singapore, the United States and elsewhere throughout the world.  The
      book chronicles major breakthroughs in both adult and embryonic stem cell research
      including the huge impact that adult stem cell research has had on the treatment
      and cure of leukemia.  Research has also shown great promise for stem cell therapies
      capable of regenerating healthy heart tissue.  \r\n\r\nFox tells the story of
      Dr. Emerson Perin from the Texas Heart Institute who has injected bone marrow
      stem cells into damaged heart tissue with remarkable results. Although Perin
      has since conducted clinical trials in the United States, he chose to perform
      his initial treatments in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.  His first
      patient was a male in heart failure and very near death.  Perin had difficulty
      finding enough live tissue in which to inject the stem cells.  He did so and
      then left for the US.  When he returned three months later to inject more stem
      cells, he found the patient tan and smiling.  A month later, the patient was
      \"jogging on the beach.\"\r\n\r\nStem cells have been shown to be both a partial
      cause and a potential cure for heart disease. Scientists believe that this is
      also the case with Cancer.\r\n\r\nAnother area where bone marrow stem cells
      have demonstrated a remarkable effect is in the area of organ transplants.  Researchers
      have found that injecting bone marrow stem cells from donors into transplant
      recipients prior to transplantation reduces or eliminates the need for immunosuppressive
      drugs, which ultimately hurt the patient.  The injection of stem cells cause
      the body to establish two immune systems so when the body receives the new organ
      from the donor, its new immune system recognizes does not view the organ as
      \"foreign\" and does not attack it.\r\n\r\nFox discusses the controversy surrounding
      the use of human embryonic stem cells (hES)and therapeutic cloning.    She notes
      that the impact of the Bush restriction on hES research has resulted in many
      countries such as South Korea and China attempting to take a leadership role
      in the development of new stem cell therapies.  In so doing, they have aggressively
      pursued the leading minds in the field.  The restrictions have created a reluctance
      among stem cell researcher institutions in the US to pursue ground breaking
      studies, fearing that they might lose vital NIH funding.\r\n\r\nOne argument
      often heard in the stem cell debate is that all of the major breakthroughs have
      involved adult, rather than embryonic stem cells.  Fox points out that adult
      stem cell research, mainly blood stem cells, has been on-going for 50 years,
      while hES research is in its infancy.  She also points out that the Bush Administration
      has provided over 10 times as much funding for Adult Stem Cell research as for
      hES research.  Even at that, the US investment in any type of stem cell research
      has been modest.  In 2004, Fox points out, the US spent less than $230 million
      on all human stem cell research.  The same year, Singapore spent $1 billion.\r\n\r\nOne
      adverse impact of the restrictions placed on hES research in the US has been
      the fact that countries like South Korea and China have much lower standards
      for monitoring and evaluating scientific research.  Fox chronicles the rise
      and fall of Woo Suk Hwang, a South Korean stem cell scientist who for several
      years was credited with major breakthroughs in stem cell research.  Eventually,
      much of his research was discredited and found to be fraudulent.  This rocked
      the scientific community.\r\n\r\nNote:  During the week of November 19, 2007,
      the day after I finished reading this book, it was announced that two scientists
      had discovered a way to create hES-like cells from skin cells, eliminating the
      need to destroy an embryo.  One of the scientists making this announcement was
      Dr. James A. Thomson from the University of Wisconsin.  Dr. Thomson actually
      initiated research into hES cells and has grappled with the ethical debate ever
      since.\r\n\r\nThe second research team to announce the breakthrough was led
      by Shinya Yamanaka from the University of Kyoto in Japan and the University
      of California in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomson believes that the method
      that only requires adding four genes to the skin cells should eliminate the
      need to destroy embryos to create hES cells."

    - Exodus to the Virtual World
    - "Edward Castronova is an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies
      in Telecommunications at Indiana University. He is the author of Synthetic Worlds
      and has been featured on \"60 Minutes,\" NPR and the New York Times.\r\n\r\nExodus
      to the Virtual World explores the present and future impact of the rapidly growing
      number of people who regularly participate in Virtual World experiences.  These
      experiences may take the form of online games, such as \"World of Warcraft,\"
      or 3D Virtual Universes such as \"Second Life.\"\r\n\r\nCastronova uses Second
      Life as an illustration of this rapid growth. Launched in 2003, Second Life
      boasted several hundred thousand registrations by 2006. By 2007, this number
      had grown to 5 million. As participation has grown, so has the Second Life Virtual
      Economy.  Castronova notes that commerce in Virtual Worlds cross over to the
      real world economy, accounting for several hundred million dollars per year.
      \ As more and more people participate in these worlds, the amount of commerce
      conducted within them will increase exponentially.   Eventually, Castronova
      suggests, this will have an impact on the country's GNP requiring that goods
      and services produced within the Virtual Worlds be included in these calculations.\r\n\r\nThe
      primary focus of Exodus to the Virtual World deals with the impact that Virtual
      World experiences may have on the expectations of citizens when dealing with
      their real world society.  Castronova speculates that as people move into Virtual
      Worlds, they will assess the policies that govern the Virtual World and may
      ask why real-world policies do not reflect the same values.  One characteristic
      of Virtual Worlds that many do not find in their real-world environments is
      \"Fun.\"  Castronova discusses the \"Fun Economy\" and \"Fun Policy\" that future
      real-world leaders may need to consider in their planning.\r\n\r\nCastronova
      states, \"increasing numbers of new workers will come to expect this sort of
      thing: working with whomever they want, whenever they want, at whatever tasks
      they want, and receiving regular rewards for every little thing they accomplish.\"\r\n\r\nOne
      area that Castronova states must become more fun is education.  He describes
      this new paradigm. \"Education that's limited in scope, but polished by design,
      with open access, most rules in the code, ad hoc teamwork, and shared myths.\"\r\n\r\n\"We
      are called not to solve the problems of others, but rather to create for them
      problem spaces within which they can realize their full potential as happy,
      healthy human beings.  It is neither giving a poor man, or your own son, a fish,
      nor is it teaching him to fish.  It is the act of creating a river environment
      in which the man, your son, would find so much joy in the act of fishing that
      he would teach it to himself.\""

    - The Myths of Innovation
    - "Scott Berkun worked at Microsoft from 1994-2003. Much of the that time was
      spent working on the Internet Explorer Team. Since leaving Microsoft, Berkun
      has made his living writing, speaking and teaching.\r\n\r\nIn his book, Berkun
      identifies 10 myths often associated with Innovation.\r\n\r\n1. The Myth of
      Epiphany.  Berkun contends that history depicts many of the most important innovations
      as being born out of a revelation experienced by a gifted or lucky individual.
      He cites the apple that purportedly fell on Sir Issac Newton's head. Berkun
      points out that this event never happened and that Newton's explanation of gravity
      actually followed 20 years of hard work primarily in the area of mathematics.\r\n\r\n2.
      We understand the history of Innovation. As the first myth suggests, history
      does not tend to depict Innovation accurately. History describes events in a
      linear and orderly fashion that generally corresponds to a timeline. Innovation,
      however, tends to occurs in a divergent manner with many possible outcomes.\r\n\r\n3.There
      is a method for innovation.  There is no recipe for Innovation. Every innovation
      can follow many different paths and may have many different outcomes.\r\n\r\n4.
      People love new ideas.  Berkun points out that Innovations asks people to have
      faith in something unknown rather than something known to be safe and/or pleasant.
      This often results in a paradox where Innovations holding the greatest potential
      often encounter the greatest resistance. Berkun offers the examples of Microsoft,
      Google, Apple, HP and Yahoo, all of which were rejected my major corporations
      when first presented. He also notes that the world might have been very different
      if this rejection had not occurred. \r\n\r\n5. The Lone Inventor.  History often
      attributes major Innovations to individuals or small groups. In fact, Berkun
      states, every Innovation is built upon the work of many people over extended
      periods of time. Interestingly, Innovations only began to be attributed to individuals
      after the Renaissance. Prior to that period, it was considered culturally inappropriate
      to credit people with such accomplishments.\r\n\r\n6. Good ideas are hard to
      find.  Berkun quotes Einstein who said, \"imagination is more important than
      knowledge.\" Berkun goes on to express concern at the fact that neither the
      workplace or the school reflect this. Both, he contends, value \"conformance
      of mind\" over creativity.\r\n\r\n7. Your boss knows more about innovation than
      you do.  This is a common myth among employees who assume that their managers
      have greater expertise and knowledge so they must be more capable of innovation.
      Berkun points out that, \"high experience and confidence make people the greatest
      resistors to new ideas as they have the most to lose.\"\r\n\r\n8. The best ideas
      win.  Berkun provides examples where this clearly wasn't the case. One of the
      most interesting was the metric system. Thomas Jefferson realized that the English
      system of measurement was confusing. He developed an alternative system based
      on units of 10 that was basically the precursor to the metric system.  He presented
      it to Congress in 1789 and the response was less than enthusiastic. In 1793,
      France adopted the metric system, however, and it spread throughout the world
      as the dominant system of measurement. It is used in 190 of 193 nations today.\r\n\r\n9.
      Problems and Solutions.  Berkun states, \"Discovering problems actually requires
      just as much creativity as discovering solutions.\"\r\n\r\n10.Innovation is
      always good.  Berkun provides many examples of how Innovations that were developed
      for the best of reasons have also proven to have very negative effects. One
      example, DDT, was developed to eliminate Malaria. While it was very effective
      in doing so, the unanticipated effects were very negative. Another example was
      the development of aircraft, which greatly enhanced travel and communication,
      but also led to unprecedented destruction during war time.  This led Berkun
      to conclude that there is \"one truth: all innovations combine good and bad
      effects regardless of the intention of the innovator or how well designed they
      are.\""

    - Innovation Nation
    - "John Kao taught a course on Innovation at the Harvard Business School for 14
      years. He also served as a visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab and as a
      Distinguished Visiting Professor of Innovation at the U.S. Postgraduate School.
      He is also a consultant to Fortune 500 companies and an accomplished musician
      and movie producer.\r\n\r\nInnovation Nation describes how the United States
      is losing its leadership role in innovation while other countries are placing
      great emphasis on fostering innovation. Kao points out that innovation drives
      the global economy and those countries that foster and support it stand to gain
      the most, while others fall behind.\r\n\r\nKao states, \"And the obvious first
      step is simply to acknowledge the challenges we face at a national level.  After
      which, we must develop a compelling vision and a blueprint for action that will
      reinvent the way we educate our children.\"\r\n\r\nKao notes that, \"innovation
      emerges when different bodies of knowledge, perspectives, and disciplines are
      brought together.\" He describes the evolution of innovation as: version 1.0
      - individual visionary inventors such as Benjamin Franklin, version 2.0 - industrial
      innovation through such organizations as Bell Labs, Xerox's PARC etc., version
      3.0 - deinstitutionalized innovation ie. the innovator-entrepreneur, version
      4.0 globally diffuse innovation.\r\n\r\nNations must seek innovations to address
      the \"wicked problems\" that face the world today.  According to Kao, \"wicked
      problems rarely have clear-cut solutions that can be unlocked by a single discipline.
      They are complex and ambiguous.\"  Unfortunately, in the US, we are accustomed
      to solving \"tame problems,\" which are easily defined and have clear boundaries
      that lend themselves to orderly, linear thinking.\r\n\r\nKao provides statistics
      that he says may portend a \"Perfect Storm\" that threatens the US as an Innovative
      Nation.  Rapidly increasing global competition for our institutions of higher
      education. Asian students are less like seek higher education in the US.  Between
      1994 and 1998, the number of Asian students pursuing doctorates in the US dropped
      by 19%, while the number who chose to pursue these degrees in their homeland
      almost doubled.  Kao quotes Patrick Callan, president of the National Center
      for Public Policy and Higher Education who observed that America's strength
      is in its population that is closest to retirement, while the strength of other
      countries lies with its youth.\r\n\r\nStatistic: The US ranks 17 out of 33 countries
      surveyed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in tax
      incentives for R & D.\r\n\r\nKao notes that \"Talent is everywhere.\"  Chinese
      high school students must all take advanced math and science courses. 40% of
      US students take no advanced science courses beyond introductory biology. Most
      of the math and science teachers in China have advanced degrees in their instructional
      areas. In the US less that 60% of science teachers and 48% of math teachers
      have degrees in the subject areas.\r\n\r\nStatistic: April 2006, US Department
      of Defense's annual selection of leading edge technologies.  Twenty of the forty-two
      projects selected were based outside of the US.\r\n\r\nStatistic: China and
      India produce 6.5 million college graduates per year. This is 5X the number
      produced by the US.  1 million of these are engineers compared to 70,000 graduated
      in the US every year.\r\n\r\nWhile China requires all of its current students
      to master English, the first AP course in Chinese language and culture was not
      introduced in the US until May of 2007.\r\n\r\nStatistic: In 2006, California
      reported its lowest graduation rate in 10 years (67%).\r\n\r\nOn education,
      Kao states, \"We are going to have to innovate innovation in education to make
      real headway.  It's the classic innovator's dilemma: should  we choose the path
      of incremental improvement in education or seek disruptive innovations-game
      changers-in the form of financing schemes, faculty development approaches, curriculum
      design, or adoption of technology that can change the nature of the education
      enterprise?\"\r\n\r\nLabor Statistics: 1. Over the next 10 years, the number
      of jobs requiring math/computer science degrees will increase by 40%, but only
      1.1% of college students planned to major in this area.  This represented a
      66% decrease than the number five years earlier.  2. Half of America's computer-scientists,
      45% of our mathematicians and a third of our physics teachers today are foreign
      born. Half of all graduate students in engineering and 40% in the physical sciences
      in US universities are foreign born.\r\n\r\nKao offers numerous suggestions
      for ways to seduce talent to areas within the United States.  Many of these
      have to do with providing a cultural environment with museums, music and an
      interesting social life.\r\n\r\nWe need to rethink our innovation environments.
      We need to design space to encourage collaboration, work flow and idea-generation.
      \ We need to provide the right balance of public and private space.  Innovation
      Centers could include virtual space such as Second Life.\r\n\r\nStatistic: 52%
      of U.S. businesses said they had replaced Window's server software with Linux.\r\n\r\nInnovation
      tends to come from the edges, not the core.\r\n\r\nUniversity of California-San
      Diego: created new interdisciplinary department with a focus on emerging fields.\r\n\r\nConsider
      developing a program for young talented students, starting at 14 years old,
      in math and science called the \"National Innovation Fellows\" and provide mentoring,
      internship and apprentice programs along with grants and scholarships.\r\n\r\nStatistic:
      The US ranks 15th in penetration of Internet broadband.\r\n\r\nQuote: \"Innovation
      begins with collective intelligence, the interactive sparking of many minds.
      It doesn't spring forth fully formed; it is learned bit by bit from a series
      of conversations, false starts, and errors.\"\r\n\r\nQuote: \"If we are to renew
      our commitment to being the world's leading innovator, we must teach three foundational
      values-the will to mastery, the spirit of risk taking, and the embrace of continuous
      change- supplemented by a crucial fourth value that rejects the idea of global
      competition as a zero sum game."

    - "In Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation will Change the Way the World
      Learns, Clayton Christensen applies many of the concepts first discussed in
      the Innovator's Dilemma to education.\r\n\r\nChristensen notes that the United
      States is considered the most innovative nation on the planet. He points out,
      though, that most researchers do not believe that this is because of the talent
      produced by the nation's K-12 schools, but rather because the U.S. and its colleges
      and universities attract the best and the brightest from around the world. He
      cautions, as have other authors that I have read, that this advantage is beginning
      to diminish. Nations never before considered competitive, such as India and
      Singapore, have begun to invest heavily in higher education and research facilities
      to attract talent. New technologies have made it possible for top talent to
      remain at home and still work for companies anywhere in the world. Finally,
      increased restrictions placed on U.S. visas make it difficult for foreign talent
      to move to the United States.\r\n\r\nChristensen contends that U.S. schools
      can do a better job in preparing students to be innovators. They must, however,
      abandon the \"One size fits all\" mentality that today dominates. Instead, education
      must become \"modular.\" It must be able to be customized to the individual
      student's learning needs. Christensen suggests that technology currently available
      can make this possible. It can also heighten student motivation, which he states
      is the catalyst to innovation.\r\n\r\nSo, with all of the technology that currently
      fills our schools, why has this transformation not taken place. Christensen
      explains this within the context of the Innovator's Dilemma. Rather than using
      technology to transform education, schools have \"integrated\" technology so
      that it \"sustains\" rather than \"disrupts\" the existing educational system.
      This is the typical response of a successful entity. Christensen points out
      that \"Disruptive Innovation,\" never occurs at the core, but rather at the
      edges. \"Disruptive Technologies\" must be introduced where the alternative
      is \"nothing.\" Interestingly, he contends that this has already begun to occur.\r\n\r\nWith
      the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and its subsequent high-stakes testing,
      schools have significantly narrowed their focus to the core subject areas. While
      this has reduced the breadth of the curriculum, it has created opportunities
      for other educational models to move in to provide what the schools no longer
      offer directly. Much of this is being accomplished through online learning.
      Christensen points out that public education enrollments in online courses have
      skyrocketed from 45,000 in 2000 to 1 million today. Some of these courses are
      Advanced Placement courses, while others offer foreign language instruction
      not available in the schools.\r\nApplying a logarythmic formula to the rate
      of adoption of online learning, Christensen projects that 50% of high school
      courses will be taken online by 2019.\r\n\r\nAs with all disruptive technologies,
      the transformation of education will not occur through the active decision-making
      of today's educational leaders. It will simply occur as new, customizable and
      innovative practices address more and more of students' educational needs. \r\n\r\nChristensen
      urges policy and educational leaders to accelerate the adoption of these new
      educational practices within the public school programs. Yet, we know that educators
      have resisted many of these changes."

    - Here Comes Everybody
    - "Clay Shirky is a writer, speaker and professor specializing in analyzing the
      social and economic effects of the Internet.  Here Comes Everybody looks at
      the impact of the Internet on \"Organizing without organizations.\"\r\n\r\nShirky
      provides many examples of highly-disparate groups that have formed spontaneously
      around a particular issue or event simply through the use of social networking
      sites.  He begins with a disturbing story about a lost cell phone that fell
      into the hands of a 16 year old girl. The owner was able to locate the phone
      by using various social networking sites.  When the girl refused to return the
      phone, the owner's friend was able to garner widespread support and publicity
      by publishing a Blog informing the world of the situation and the girl's refusal
      to cooperate.  He used the publicity to exert pressure on the NYPD to reclassify
      the phone from missing to stolen.  Eventually, the phone was returned.  Shirky
      poses the question \"At what cost?\"  Clearly the response to this event far
      exceeded the scale it warranted, but technology made that possible.\r\n\r\nShirky
      provides other examples where cell phones were used to organize spontaneous,
      non-violent protests that had a significantly positive political outcome.\r\n\r\nShirky
      points out that most of the social chat that occurs on the web is mundane and
      intended for a small audience. He also provides evidence of tremendous creativity
      that might never have been shared without these tools.  He notes that the World
      Wide Web has transformed the whole concept of publishing turning everyone into
      potential authors, editors and publishers.  He cites the evolution of Wikipedia
      as the most dramatic example of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSome interesting observations
      with relevance to education and innovation:\r\n\r\n1. \"In some cases the change
      that threatens the profession benefits society, as did the spread of the printing
      press; even in these situations the professionals can be relied on to care more
      about self-defense than about progress.\"  This is consistent with Berkun's
      observation regarding resistance to innovation by \"experts.\"  It also supports
      the resistance to the use of technology in any transformative way in education.\r\n2.
      Cites Richard Gabriel, a programmer for Sun Microsystems, who in 1991 predicted
      that a less elegant, but more simple programming language would be more successful
      that a more elegant and sophisticated one.  He went on to conduct an experiment
      to test his theory and proved it to be correct.  This is consistent with Clayton
      Christensen's model for the introduction of disruptive innovation.\r\n3. Revolution
      doesn't happen when society adopts new technologies-it happens when society
      adopts new behaviors.\r\n4. People connected to groups beyond their own can
      expect to deliver valuable ideas. An idea that is mundane in one group can be
      a valuable insight in another. Creativity by export-import.\r\n\r\nFor a social
      networking resource to be successful it must offer a \"plausible promise,\"
      \"an effective tool,\" and \"an acceptable bargain\" with users.\r\n\r\nShirky
      also provides a good explanation of the \"Small World\" concept. This theory
      says that the world is made up of small tightly-connected groups (networks)
      and larger loosely-connected groups. They intersect at various points (people)
      and create short routes to interpersonal connectivity.  This concept was developed
      by Duncan Watts and is explained in detail in \"Six Degrees of Separation.\""

    - The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It
    - "The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It examines the evolution of the
      PC and the Internet as generative technologies.  Generative technologies are
      those that provide a basic structure that is open to users to build upon and
      change. Generative technologies, according to Zittrain, \"begin with the ambitious
      planting of a flag for a new enterprise in an overlooked backwater.  The procrastination
      principal, gives license for the idea's technical and social blueprints to be
      incomplete.  Contribution is welcome from outsiders, and if the project takes
      off, the results may prove completely unexpected.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most vivid
      examples of a generative technology at the content level would be Wikipedia.
      Zittrain points out, however, that the PC and Internet themselves are generative
      in that they allow others to build entirely new programs upon their foundation.
      \ Critical to generativity are the concepts of \"procrastination\" and \"end-to-end\"
      connectivity.  Procrastination allows developers to establish a foundation with
      the expectation that problems will be solved  by the community as they arise.
      \ Thus, innovation is not delayed while trying to anticipate and solve every
      problem.  End-to-end connectivity refers to net neutrality.  This is a founding
      principle of the Internet and distinguishes it from propriety networks such
      as Compuserve and AOL.  The Internet does not discriminate among bits.  All
      control and content resides with the end points.\r\n\r\nGenerativity represents
      the greatest benefit and the greatest threat to the Internet and the PC.  The
      openness that it affords also allows for development and spread of malware such
      as worms and viruses. It provides transport for spam and a platform for pornography
      and other undesirable content. It also provides opportunities for identity theft
      and the loss of privacy.\r\n\r\nZittrain suggests that despite the very substantial
      benefits that generative technologies have provided society, the problems caused
      by viruses, security breaches and other negative exploits threaten to encourage
      people to move away from open technologies to more centrally-controlled technical
      \"appliances.\"  These appliances, such as TiVO and the iPod are closed systems
      controlled by a central authority such as the manufacturer.  Enhancements and
      upgrades are determined by this authority.  While this protects against infiltration
      by bad citizens, it also restricts innovation and creativity.  It provides opportunities
      for misuse such as surveillance of users and \"perfect enforcement\" of laws
      and regulation, which has never been possible in the past. Examples include
      On Star that has the ability to track location and conversation in cars even
      when not in use.  Another is the cell phone that can monitor conversation even
      when off.\r\n\r\nZittrain does not suggest that the problems caused by generative
      technologies do not need to be controlled.  He provides examples of how communities,
      free from any centralized control, effectively police generative programs such
      as social networking sites.  He notes that grass roots approaches are generally
      more effective than more centralized approaches because there is more buy-in
      by users.  They also lead to the establishment of social norms, which are more
      powerful than laws.\r\n\r\nZittrain refers to the traditional, centralized approach
      to security as Security 1.0 and security woven into the generative environment
      as Security 2.0."

    - Hot, Flat and Crowded
    - "In Hot, Flat and Crowded, Friedman examines the critical issue of dirty energy
      and its impact on the world. He identifies five key problems caused by the world's
      reliance on dirty energy: 1. energy supply and demand, 2. climate change, 3.
      energy poverty, 4. petropolitics, and 5. biodiversity loss. He contends that
      these problems grew to critical proportion in 2000 and, while they pose the
      greatest threat to global society, they also present a tremendous opportunity
      for companies and nations willing to address them.\r\n\r\nFriedman expands upon
      his research in The World is Flat, pointing out the impact that the rapid growth
      in India and China are having on energy consumption. He notes that he often
      hears the Chinese complain that the US, and other industrialized nations expect
      China to curb its growing appetite for dirty energy after the industrialized
      nations have used these resources without restraint for decades. Friedman states
      that he is fine with China not seeking clean energy, because it gives the US
      an opportunity to emerge as a leader in what he believes will be the largest
      economic growth market since the Information Technology boom.\r\n\r\nFriedman's
      discussion of \"Petropolitics\" was particularly interesting. He noted that
      the growth of freedom in Petrodictatorships is inversely proportional to the
      price of oil.  Money spent on dirty energy supports both sides of the war on
      terrorism. In addition to producing dangerous climate change, our addiction
      to oil is \"helping to strengthen the most intolerant, antimodern, anti-Western,
      anti-women's rights, and antipluralistic strain of Islam.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard
      to climate change, Friedman warns that \"different highly disruptive, nonlinear
      changes in climate might interact with and amplify one another.\" This is consistent
      with warnings by James Lovelock in \"The Revenge of Gaia.\"  Friedman suggests
      that such a concept is difficult for the human mind to grasp.  He states that
      in the \"Energy-Climate\" Era, we must think exponentially rather than linearly.\r\n\r\nWhile
      much of this book is very disturbing, it does maintain a positive perspective.
      \ Friedman believes that the challenge to achieve clean energy is achievable
      and that the US is well-positioned to assume a leadership role in developing
      clean energy resources.  If it does, Friedman contends that the US will dominate
      the world economy well into the foreseeable future.  He notes, however, that
      significant policy changes at the federal level will be necessary to accomplish
      this."

    - A Whole New Mind
    - "In a Whole New Mind, Daniel Pink contends that three characteristics of the
      21st Century World, Abundance, Asia and Automation, have altered the skills
      one needs to succeed in the US and other developed nations.  Pink posits that
      the highly linear, logical and analytical skills need in the practice of law,
      accounting and computer programming no longer hold the value that they once
      did. This is largely because much of this work can now be outsourced to countries
      paying much lower wages, but offering equal quality such as those in Asia.\r\n\r\nPink
      states that the US has moved to another \"Age\" in its development, which he
      calls the Conceptual Age.  Skills needed in the conceptual stage are more holistic
      in nature with a greater emphasis on synthesis, interpersonal skills and the
      ability to recognize patterns. These skills, Pink explains, rely on the right-brain
      rather than the left. Pink points out that this represents a major shift, since
      right-brain skills have never received the same level of respect as the more
      logical skills associated with the left brain. Thus, right-brain development
      has not received the same level of attention.\r\n\r\nPink proposes six \"Senses\"
      that he feels are essential to success in the modern economy. The first is Design.
      \ In an age of abundance, when consumers have almost unlimited choices, function
      is no longer enough.  Thus, appearance and design becomes the differentiating
      factor.  Aesthetic appeal has become paramount. A person with a good sense of
      design stands to prosper.\r\n\r\nThe second sense is Story.  The Information
      Age has inundated the world with information and data.  Today, the successful
      person must be able to provide context and meaning to that data through story-telling
      or narrative.\r\n\r\nThe third sense is Symphony.  Pink notes that the Information
      Age exalted specialization and focus, but that highly specialized talents such
      as computer programming are easily exportable.  Today the person who can \"put
      the parts together.\"  One must be able to cross boundaries and work in concert
      with others.\r\n\r\nThe fourth sense is Empathy.  The ability to understand
      how other other human beings feel is something that computers cannot do.  There
      is a growing emphasis on this in medicine and business.\r\n\r\nThe fifth sense
      is Play. The ability to have fun and to laugh has been shown to have significant
      health benefits, as-well-as the ability to increase productivity.  Pink describes
      how \"Laugh Clubs,\" invented by Madan Kataria, an Indian Physician, have spread
      around the world and have improved people's health and spirit.\r\n\r\nThe final
      sense is Meaning.  Here, Pink refers to the seminal book by Victor Frankel entitled,
      \"Man's Search for Meaning.\" Pink notes that abundance and automation have
      allowed mankind greater opportunity to seek meaning in their lives.  While this
      has always been a primary concern, few have had time to devote to the quest.
      \ Pink suggests that those who cultivate meaning in their lives today, through
      meditation or some other means, tend to enjoy greater success."

    - Crowdsourcing
    - "Jeff Howe coined the term Crowdsourcing in an article that he wrote for Wired
      Magazine.  Howe created the term to describe the impact of technology on shrinking
      the distance between producer and consumer.  Howe provides many examples of
      how people with a passion for a particular area of interest are willing to spend
      many hours to create and share their knowledge and expertise.  Many of these
      people do not have formal training in these areas, but have developed great
      skill on their own. Technology allows them to find others who share their passion,
      which often leads to remarkable results.\r\n\r\nTwo examples that Howe provides
      are iStock Photo and Innocentive.  iStock Photo was created to provide amateur
      photographers with a place to upload and share their photographs. An extremely
      enthusiastic response from photographers led to a rapidly expanding inventory
      of photographs that could be easily downloaded and used on other websites and
      publications.  Eventually, iStock Photo began charging a small fee for the use
      of the photos, which they then shared with the photographers.  This had a very
      significant impact on the Stock Photo industry where photographs by professionals
      were often very expensive.  Since the difference in quality of many of the photos
      was negligible, this drove down prices across the industry.\r\n\r\nInnocentive
      is a website developed by Proctor and Gamble and some other Fortune 500 companies
      to tap the aggregate expertise of the \"Crowd.\"  The website registers \"Seekers\"
      and \"Solvers.\"  The Seekers are companies that submit problems that they want
      to have solved. They are often Fortune 500 companies and they offer cash incentives
      to anyone who can solve the problems.  The problems are usually related to scientific
      issues. Anyone can register as a solver.  The site has been highly successful
      and many of the solutions have been come from people outside the field of study.\r\n\r\nHowe
      contends that the \"Wisdom of the Crowd\" almost always outperforms groups of
      experts under certain circumstances.  One of the most important elements is
      that the crowd must be diverse.  Diversity allows for many different perspectives
      and ideas.  In a diverse crowd, incorrect and/or illogical solutions tend to
      cancel each other out and the correct solution tends to emerge. In a non-diverse
      group, the likelihood of the incorrect answers being canceled out diminishes.\r\n\r\nAnother
      important element in successful Crowdsourcing is that tasks must be modularized.
      \ Thus, people must be able to work on different aspects of a problem or issue
      simultaneously.  This is the greatest strength of Crowdsourcing, as well.  Such
      an approach allows huge projects to be completed in a remarkably short time."

    - Return of Depression Economics & Crisis of 2008
    - "Paul Krugman is the 2008 Nobel Prize winner for Economics.  He is also a professor
      of economics at Princeton University and formerly was a professor of economics
      at MIT.  The current book is an update of an earlier publication by Krugman
      published in 1999.  Both books analyze the \"Asian Crisis,\" which led to financial
      crises in Japan, Thailand and Indonesia.  Krugman also examines similar crises
      in Argentina and Australia.  He then relates how these financial crises foreshadowed
      the economic crisis that the US and much of the rest of the world is currently
      experiencing in 2008.\r\n\r\nOne element that Krugman highlights is the impact
      of globalization on the world economy.  He notes that individual policies on
      the value of currency and exchange rates have had a serious impact on the global
      economy.  In some cases, investors have employed risky strategies based upon
      favorable exchange rates to borrow and lend money.  When the exchange rates
      changed, this led to panic in some cases and the inability for investors to
      cover debt.  Poor decisions on monetary policy left too little cash in circulation
      in some nations and this led to deep recession.\r\n\r\nOne element that led
      to the current crisis in the US, according to Krugman, has been the emergence
      of a \"Shadow Banking System.\"  This system included investment banks, trusts
      and auction rate securities (invented by Lehman Brothers in 1984).  These institutions
      provided many of the same services as banks, but did not fall under the same
      regulatory control of the government.  They, therefore, were able to engage
      in higher risk investing, but were not protected by the FDIC.  When the housing
      bubble burst and much of the collateral that guaranteed loans and other investments
      depreciated, investors began to pull their money from these services.  This,
      in the view of Krugman, was analogous to runs on the bank circa 1930.  This
      led to the failure of many of these services, such as Lehman Bros., and the
      need for federal bailout of others.  More importantly, it led to the elimination
      of a substantial source of credit, which led to a contraction of the economy.\r\n\r\nThe
      title, The Return of Depression Economics, refers to the fact that we now face
      a situation where productive capacity in the US and elsewhere is greater than
      demand.  This is caused by a lack of available credit and fear on the part of
      the consumer.  Krugman contends that this repudiates the contention of \"Supply
      Side Economics,\" that there will always be adequate demand if there is adequate
      production and that economic policy need only consider the supply side of the
      equation.  Krugman refers to John Maynard Keynes throughout the book.  \r\n\r\nKeynes
      was an economist in the 1930s who analyzed the causes of the Great Depression
      and concluded that governments must regulate the banking industry to avoid future
      disasters.  He also concluded that the Depression could have been avoided if
      early in the recession, the federal government had lowered interest rates to
      increase credit and investment and had infused cash into the economy through
      deficit spending.  Such an intervention would stabilize recessions and avoid
      catastrophe.  \r\n\r\nKrugman calls this the Keynesian Compact and notes that
      it has proven so effective since the 1930s that most economists felt that the
      possibility of a 1930 style Depression was no longer a threat.  Some even believed
      that the \"business cycle\" was no longer relevant.\r\n\r\nTo address the current
      crisis, Krugman concludes that the Federal Government must do more to stimulate
      the economy by spending on public works projects and by taking other dramatic
      stimulus measures.  He also suggests that any organization that performs banking-type
      services must be regulated to protect against a \"run\" on a \"Shadow Banking
      System.\""

    - "Bill Tancer is the general manager of Global Research at Hitwise, an online
      competitive intelligence company.  In Click, Tancer describes how tracking trends
      in online search terms, as-well-as analyzing \"Clickstreams,\" can provide useful
      data about what people are thinking, what they value and what they fear.\r\n\r\nHitwise
      collects and analyzes web search data to determine trends that can help clients
      in marketing their products.  Using this real-time methodology, Tancer is able
      to identify trends in customer behavior long before they become apparent using
      traditional marketing analysis tools.  In Click, Tancer describes some of the
      data that he has accrued through his research and suggests what this data tells
      us about ourselves.\r\n\r\nTancer begins by noting that the most popular search
      terms and web sites tend to be associated with \"Porn, Pills or Casinos (PPC).\"
      \ One interesting trend that he has noted, however, is that as the popularity
      of Social Networking sites has increased, the interest in adult web sites has
      decreased. \r\n\r\nThe analysis of PPC data and other search topics also reveals
      consistent temporal associations. Adult sites seem to be least popular on Sundays,
      which might be expected. Gambling sites tend to shift according to sports seasons.\r\n\r\nA
      vivid example of where online search term data provided evidence of a disconnect
      between customer interest and marketing attempts dealt with Prom Dresses. Tancer's
      data showed the highest interest in Prom Dresses online occurred in January.
      \ Most dress manufacturers and retailers, however, did not begin their marketing
      efforts until March.\r\n\r\nTancer challenges some of the basic assumption regarding
      Web 2.0.  He notes that the assumption is that many of the visitors to these
      sites are contributors of content, rather than simply consumers.  In fact, Tancer
      provides evidence that only a very small percentage of visitors to sites such
      as YouTube (0.16%) or Flickr (0.18%)actually upload content. The demographics
      for contributors for these two sites tend to be young and, in the case of YouTube,
      tend to be male.  Wikipedia has a larger contributor rate of 3.5% with contributors
      being older on average.\r\n\r\nOriginally, people tended to believe that the
      80/20 rule applied to Web 2.0 sites with 20% of the visitors providing 80% of
      the content.  Tancer states that this is not the case with Web 2.0 sites.  He
      subscribes to the 1/9/90 rule where 1% of the visitors to web sites represent
      regular contributors, 9% represent occasional or one time contributors and 90%
      are simply consumers, or \"lurkers.\"\r\n\r\nTancer concludes his book with
      a discussion of how innovation and disruptive change occur in online services.
      \ He references the work of Everett Rogers, who coined the phrase, \"diffusion
      of innovation.\"  After conducting extensive research into the introduction
      and spread of innovative products (hybrid corn seed), Rogers noted that level
      of acceptance occurred on a bell curve.  He identified five distinct groups
      including: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards.
      \ He noted that the key to rapid diffusion lay in the hands of the early adopters.\r\n\r\nTancer
      used the rapid rise and dominance of YouTube to illustrate this phenomenon.
      \ Tancer noted that YouTube actually entered at a time when there were many
      video sites.  Yet, it vaulted from \"obscurity to ubiquity\" in a span of just
      35 days.  This was largely due to early adopters sending links and recommendations
      to friends."

    - Wikinomics
    - "Co-author - Anthony D. Williams.\r\n\r\nWikinomics was originally published
      in 2006 with the expanded edition being released in 2008.  Wikinomics is a new
      business model that is based upon four principles: 1. Openness, 2. Peering,
      3. Sharing and 4. Acting Globally.\r\n\r\nThe authors contend that \"Learning
      to engage and co-create with a shifting set of self-organized partners is becoming
      an essential skill, as important as budgeting, R&D, and planning.  \r\n\r\nWikinomics
      provides many examples of self-forming groups coming together to collaborate
      on complex projects and to solve problems.  Many of these, such as the development
      of the Linux operating system and Apache web server, occurred in the Open Source
      Community.  Tapscott and Williams, however, point out that this movement towards
      mass collaboration extends to non-technology oriented enterprises as well.\r\n\r\nExamples
      include: 1) The SNP Consortium, created by 12 pharmaceutical firms in 1999 to
      share genetic information through publicly accessible databases, 2)Procter and
      Gamble, Eli Lilly and others who established Innocentive to seek outside assistance
      in conducting R&D, and 3) Boeing, which adopted a \"Global Plant Floor,\" allowing
      suppliers from around the world to collaborate on the design and development
      of the 787 Luxury Liner.\r\n\r\nOne key observation by the authors was that
      the distance between producers and consumers has diminished markedly.  In fact,
      the authors coined a new term, \"Prosumers\" to describe this phenomena.  One
      example of this was BMW, who invited consumers to offer design recommendations
      to be incorporated into its cars.  Probably the most vivid examples, however,
      come from the realm of the news media, where consumers constantly use the technology
      on their belts and desktops to upload images, videos and text to describe events
      happening around them."

    - Grown Up Digital
    - "Grown Up Digital is based upon a $4 million research project funded by several
      large corporations.  It reports on studies that investigated the lifestyles,
      values, work habits and social mores of young people mostly between the ages
      of 18 and 30, whom Tapscott calls the Net Generation. Researchers associated
      with the Tapscott study interviewed 7,685 randomly selected Net Geners worldwide.
      \ Members of the research team also interviewed a sample of 1,600 representatives
      of the X-Generation (30-41) and Boomers (42-61) from the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nTapscott's
      findings refute many of the negative characterizations of the Net Generation.
      \ For instance, Tapscott takes exception to author Mark Bauerlein who described
      the younger generation as \"Dumbest Generation,\" a fact that he attributed
      to their preoccupation with technology.  Tapscott points out that there is no
      evidence to support this contention and that actually raw IQ scores have steadily
      risen since World War II making this generation the actually the smartest.\r\n\r\nTapscott
      identifies eight norms associated with the Net Generation.  They are: 1) Freedom;
      2) Customization; 3) Scrutiny; 4) Integrity; 5) Collaboration; 6) Entertainment;
      7) Speed; 8) Innovation.  These norms represent the Net Gens' values and expectations.
      \ Addressing his comments to CEOs and marketers, Tapscott states that successful
      businesses must address these norms when marketing to the Net Generation and
      recognize that Net Generation consumers expect to have input into products.
      \ They expect to be able to customize products to their particular needs.  Tapscott's
      research also revealed that Net Geners consider the integrity of the corporate
      citizenship of companies when making purchasing decisions.\r\n\r\nWith regard
      to education, Tapscott states that Net Geners will respond to a model of education
      that he sees emerging.  One that is student-focused, interactive, collaborative
      and customized.  He sums it up with the statement that \"It is not what you
      know that counts anymore; it's what you can learn.\"\r\n\r\nOne difference between
      the Net Generation and Baby Boomers that Tapscott and others have noted is the
      Net Generation's propensity for returning to live at home as young adults.  Some
      observers have criticized this tendency suggesting that it reflects a lack of
      desire for independence.  Tapscott offers an alternate and interesting interpretation.
      \ \r\n\r\nBoomers, Tapscott being one, grew up in highly hierarchical families.
      \ Children enjoyed little freedom at home.  Outside the home, however, they
      experienced a great deal of freedom.  Children and teens left home in the morning
      to play and had little adult supervision throughout the day.  Boomers as parents,
      however, embraced a very different approach to parenting.  They became much
      more involved in their childrens' lives outside the home.  They structured play
      time, rehearsals, sports etc.  At home, they tended to parent in a much more
      democratic way providing children with more input into decision-making.  Eventually,
      with the ability to socially network with friends from home, Net Geners actually
      experienced more freedom and independence at home than outside of the home.
      \ Thus, Tapscott concludes that, unlike Boomers who longed to escape the restrictive
      home environment, Net Geners view home as a place where they can be independent.
      \ Tapscott also notes that the majority of Net Geners interviewed reported good
      relationships with their parents.\r\n\r\nTapscott concludes with an examination
      of how the Net Generation has begun to participate in community service and
      the political process.  In both cases, Net Geners are showing increased interest
      and activity.  Tapscott highlights the success enjoyed by the Obama campaign
      in reaching this generation through the use of social networking tools.  This
      appealed, he suggests, to the Net Gener's desire to collaborate with governmental
      officials, rather than simply vote."

    - Outliers
    - "In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell explores factors that lead to extraordinary success.
      \ As the title implies, Gladwell refers to those who enjoy such success as \"Outliers.\"
      \ Examples of Outliers include Bill Gates, the Beatles and Robert Oppenheimer
      among others.\r\n\r\nGladwell analyzed the personal attributes, culture and
      circumstances that surrounded extremely successful individuals from the realm
      of sports, business and law and discovered similarities within their backgrounds
      that greatly enhanced their potential for success.  Conversely, he found that
      others who, while they shared the Outliers' personal attributes, did not share
      their culture or backgrounds.  These individuals experienced far less success
      in life despite having extraordinary intelligence.\r\n\r\nGladwell first considered
      elite athletes and discovered that highly successful athletes tended to have
      birthdays that fell within the same quarter of the year.  These birthdays tended
      to fall in the months just following the cutoff dates for selection of youth
      travel teams.  Thus, when eligible to try out, these players tended to be older
      and more mature.  This gave them a decided advantage when trying out for the
      top-level youth teams.  Once chosen, these players then tended to receive better
      coaching and more practice, which further enhanced their level of achievement.
      \ Over time, the gap between the players with the earlier and later birth dates
      became more and more pronounced, leading Gladwell to conclude that the single
      most significant determiner of success among these athletes was the month in
      which they were born.\r\n\r\nGladwell found similar external influences in determining
      success in business.  Using Bill Gates as an example of an Outlier in the area
      of business, Gladwell pointed out that Gates was the son of two highly successful
      parents.  He attended a private school where he was given access to a time-share
      computer when even students at top universities did not have such an opportunity.
      \ Gates also had access to a university computer, which he used each day, rising
      at 3 AM and working until approximately 6 AM.  Gates had other opportunities
      that allowed him to practice and develop skills that others with lesser opportunities
      could not.\r\n\r\nGladwell stressed the impact of parenting and culture on the
      eventual success of Outliers.  He provided examples of Jewish lawyers who honed
      their skills at acquisition law at a time when large firms that would not hire
      them also had no interest in this area of the law.  Eventually, acquisition
      law became very important and lucrative and the skills that the Jewish lawyers
      had developed made them extremely valuable.\r\n\r\nGladwell drew the comparison
      between Chris Langan and Robert Oppenheimer.  Both had extraordinary IQ's, although
      Langan had a superior IQ to Oppenheimer.  Langan, while able to learn and retain
      information quickly, never achieved great success.  Oppenheimer, on the other
      hand, achieved great success despite being disorganized and depressed (he tried
      to kill his mentor!).  The difference was that Oppenheimer, thanks to his upbringing
      and early social experiences, had self-confidence and the ability to negotiate
      and advocate for himself.  Langan, coming from a much more humble background,
      never developed these skills.\r\n\r\nGladwell concludes that, while IQ differentiates
      people, it does not serve as a reliable predictor of success once an individual
      has reached a threshold of around 120.  From that point on, the differentiators
      are closely tied to experience, practice, culture and good luck.  Gladwell cites
      the Terman longitudinal study of the gifted in support of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIf
      there is a single prerequisite for success, Gladwell posits that it is practice
      and hard work.  He states that successful people do not just \"work harder\"
      than others, but that they work, \"really, really, really harder.\"  In fact,
      Gladwell states that 10,000 hours of practice represents the demarcation line
      between the truly great and the good, regardless of innate ability."

    - The 10 Faces of Innovation
    - "Thomas Kelley is the general manager of IDEO and the author of two books on
      Innovation. The Ten Faces of Innovation is based upon Kelley's work at IDEO,
      a consulting firm specializing in innovative design work.\r\n\r\nKelley bases
      The Ten Faces of Innovation upon the premise that successful and innovative
      organizations are comprised of people who play many different roles.  The most
      destructive of these is the \"Devil's Advocate.\" Kelly suggests that, although
      the Devil's Advocate usually attempts to frame their comments as being productive
      and provocative, their real purpose is simply to derail innovative and creative
      ideas. Kelly points out that the Devil's Advocate rarely offers positive alternatives,
      but simply tosses out negative comments feeling no responsibility to defend
      them.\r\n\r\nKelley contends that innovative organizations need to discourage
      the role of the Devil's Advocate and develop and promote characteristics and
      skills which he describes as the ten faces of innovation.  While many employees
      in organizations have these characteristics and skills, if an organization does
      not identify and encourage them, they may go untapped.\r\n\r\nThe Ten Faces
      of Innovation are:\r\n1. The Anthropologist - immerses oneself into the culture
      and context to better understand values, behaviors, needs etc.\r\n2. The Experimenter
      - \"Fail often and succeed sooner.\" \"Don't wait at the starting line trying
      to figure out the whole race. Just get moving and start trying things out.\"
      \ Believes in rapid prototyping.\r\n3. The Cross-Pollinator - \"T-Shaped Individuals\"
      Have broad knowledge and interests with deep knowledge in a particular area.
      Tend to move among different groups sharing ideas.\r\n4. The Hurdler - jumps
      over or navigates around obstacles such as company bureaucracy, budget constraints,
      initial failures etc. to achieve a goal.\r\n5. The Collaborator - values teamwork.
      Kelley uses the metaphor of passing the baton in a relay race. The collaborator
      ensures smooth exchanges.\r\n6. The Director - view casting as the most important
      task. Gives center stage to others. Promotes brainstorming and rising to tough
      challenges. \"Exploring new ideas isn't just about making things and services.
      It's about changing people's behaviors and attitudes.\"\r\n7. The Experience
      Architect - understands that even the most mundane commodity can distinguish
      itself if it provides a meaningful and enjoyable experience. Designing such
      an experience requires understanding the \"journey\" that the customer travels
      when interacting with the organization and its products and services.\r\n8.
      The Set Designer - creates an environment that fosters creativity and innovation.\r\n9.
      The Care Giver - empathetic to the impact of innovation on the consumer. Winston
      Churchill said, \"I am always ready to learn, though I don't always like being
      taught.\" The Care Giver seeks to help others to learn without being intrusive
      or threatening\r\n10. The Story Teller - perhaps the most influential of all
      of the personas. Kelley stresses the power of the story to communicate history,
      purpose and the journey. The Story Teller appeals not just to the mind, but
      to the emotions.\r\n\r\nKelley notes that it is not necessary for an organization
      to have all of these personas present on every team for innovation to occur,
      nor do each of the roles have to be equally weighted.  He does believe that
      most organizations have people capable of fulfilling these roles and that it
      is imperative that organizations value and foster these skills and characteristics
      if they wish to be truly innovative."

    - "Larraine Segil is a business consultant and author.  Her previous books have
      focused on establishing business alliances.  Dynamic Leader, Adaptive Organization
      presents \"Ten Essential Traits\" for leaders that Segil states are necessary
      for businesses to thrive.  \r\n\r\nSegil begins the book by stating that a prerequisite

      valuable.  She also notes that, while some elephants may be visible and ignored,

    - "The Accidental Billionaires tells the story of the founding of Face Book. The
      book is an entertaining docudrama that most likely will become a movie. It tells
      the story of how Mark Zuckerberg, a computer nerd at Harvard, took a dorm room
      project and grew it into one of the most influential Internet businesses in
      the World.\r\n\r\nThe story is an excellent portrayal of the creative, innovative

      the competitive and cut throat world of Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Accidental

    - Good to Great
    - "Jim Collins has written several books on what makes businesses succeed and
      fail.  Good to Great compares several major organizations within the same markets
      and of similar size.  \r\n\r\nCollins paired corporations that have demonstrated
      sustained exceptional performance with similar corporations that have demonstrated
      good, but not exceptional performance. He, and his research team, then conducted
      an in-depth analysis of the companies to identify differentiators that may have
      contributed to one taking the \"Leap to Greatness\" and the other failing to
      do so.\r\n\r\nKey findings include:\r\n\r\n1) Good is the enemy of great. When
      things are good, it is too easy to settle for the status quo.\r\n2) Great Corporations
      have \"Level 5 Leaders.\"  These are leaders who are totally committed to the
      success of the organization.  They are not charismatic leaders, nor leaders
      who are concerned about their own personal prestige.  They are more likely to
      highlight the achievements of others than themselves.\r\n3) First Who then What.
      \ Having the right people \"on the bus\" is the key element to greatness.  Only
      then should an organization worry about goal setting.  The right people fit
      into the organizational culture and are committed to the organization's success.\r\n4)
      Confronting brutal facts.  In order to be successful, an organization must be
      willing to confront difficult issues. such as when something is not working.
      \ This may mean challenging beloved traditions and beliefs.  It may mean discontinuing
      programs in which the organization has heavily invested.\r\n5) Hedgehog Concept.
      \ This is the driving force behind Great Organizations.  The Hedgehog Concept
      states that an organization must focus on three things: a) What it believes
      it can be the best in the world at, b) What it feels passionate about, and c)
      what drives its economic engine.\r\n6) A culture of discipline.  If an organization
      has the right people on board, they should require little management and direction.
      \ A culture of discipline is also a culture of trust.  Members of the organization
      know that success takes hard, persistent work (pushing the flywheel)."

    - How The Mighty Fall
    - "Jim Collins is the author of Good to Great and Built to Last.  In Good to Great,
      Collins identified a series of organizational characteristics that enabled good
      corporations to leap to a sustained level of extraordinary success, which put
      them in the realm of \"Greatness.\"  Since publishing Good to Great in 2001,
      some of the organizations that had achieved sustained \"Greatness\" have fallen
      to mediocrity or even worse.  This has prompted Collins to embark on extensive
      research into what causes \"Great\" organizations to fall.\r\n\r\nCollins identified
      5 stages of decline. He illustrated each of these with a short case study.\r\n\r\n1)
      Hubris born of success.  Companies that have enjoyed a high level of success
      begin to believe that their way is always the right way.  This leads to arrogance
      and a failure to grow and adapt.\r\n2) Undisciplined pursuit of more.  Successful
      companies tend to create unrealistic growth expectations, which leads to short
      cuts and loss of focus on the company's core strengths.\r\n3) Denial of risk
      and peril.  Organizational leaders cease to confront \"brutal\" facts and fail
      to adjust to mitigate them.  They tend to externalize blame.\r\n4) Grasping
      for salvation.  This is the most dangerous stage of decline.  Here organizations
      panic. They waste time and money in recurring restructuring and seeking new
      ideas and leadership from the outside.  This tends to accelerate their demise.\r\n5)
      Capitulation to irrelevance or death.  At this point, the organization no longer
      has the will to fight.  It ceases to exist either through acquisition or dissolution.
      \r\n\r\nThe good news is that companies that fall into decline can recapture
      greatness.  Collins provides examples such as IBM that have done so.  Interestingly,
      this is rarely achieved by bringing in new, outside leadership.  Nor is it achieved
      through radical reorganization or visioning.  It is achieved by refocusing on
      the believes and core principles that led the organization to greatness in the
      first place."

    - Unscientific America
    - "Chris Mooney is a journalist who has written two books (including this one)
      on the growing alienation of science and scientists from mainstream American
      society.  Sheril Kershenbaum is the co-author of Unscientific America.  She
      is an associate at Duke University with two Masters of Science degrees in Marine
      Biology and Marine Policy.\r\n\r\nUnscientific America is an extensively researched
      and well-documented study. Although only 132 pages long, it includes 65 pages
      of notes and citations.\r\n\r\nThe overall theme of Unscientific America is
      that the prestige and influence of science and scientists in the US has diminished
      dramatically since its hey day in the '60s.  Mooney and Kershenbaum cite disturbing
      statistics that reveal the lack of interest and knowledge that Americans display
      towards science.  Mooney notes that major newspapers such as the Washington
      Post and the New York Times used to have large staffs of science reporters and
      sections devoted to science. Today the same newspapers have all but eliminated
      science reporting from their publications.\r\n\r\nThe broadcast media is no
      better.  Although cable TV offers some good science programing such as the Discovery
      Channel, the mainstream media provides very little science information. The
      authors note that if one watched five hours of cable TV news, he or she would
      only view about one minute of information pertaining to science and technology.
      \ They also note that the mainstream entertainment media is prone to stereotypical
      portrayals of science and scientists as either nerds or evil madmen.\r\n\r\nThe
      authors cite several reasons for the growing disaffection for science in American
      society.  The primary problem, they believe, is that scientists have failed
      to develop the skills necessary to communicate with the general public.  Part
      of the problem is the fact that science has become so highly specialized that
      scientists now have a difficult time even communicating with other scientists
      whose area of expertise may be in another scientific domain.  Many scientists
      look on communicating with the public as an unnecessary distraction from their
      work, which exacerbates the problem.\r\n\r\nThe authors contend that the inability
      of scientists to accurately communicate the importance of their work and the
      radical views held by some regarding God and religion have alienated many in
      society including some influential policy makers.  This has made sound scientific
      findings susceptible to challenges by radical religious groups, climate change
      doubters and other science skeptics. \r\n\r\nThe authors also disputed the often
      quoted contention that the US is not producing enough scientists and engineers.
      \ They cite the fact that between 2002 and 2007, American universities produced
      a record number of doctorates in these fields. Unfortunately, most of these
      Ph.D's leave the field of science due to lack of opportunity to advance.  While
      the number of Ph.D's has increased the number of tenure track positions in universities
      has dramatically declined leaving a very narrow and non-lucrative career path.
      \ Thus, those who actually stay in the field are often very technically proficient,
      but also tend to be extremely focused on the technical aspects of their field
      and little else.  According to the Urban Institute, American colleges and universities
      graduate three times the number of science and engineering graduates as there
      are job openings.\r\n\r\nThe authors also address the growing number of scientists
      and engineers being produced by China and India.  Mooney and Kershenbaum state
      that if the US is to have an advantage in competing with these highly trained
      graduates, it \"will lie in producing scientists with 'soft skills,' such as
      writing, speaking, and task management.\"  We must create \"more interdisciplinary
      opportunities\" and \"nurture broader sets of abilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe Urban
      Institute study states, \"In our interviews with engineering managers...rarely,
      if ever, do they say they are unable to find graduates with the requisite technical
      skills but rather the 'shortage' is of engineers with communication, management,
      interpersonal and other soft skills.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors make the following
      recommendations for K-12 education:  Partner with scientific institutions that
      can provide engaging and interesting visiting scientists to speak with students.
      \ Prepare teachers to work enthusiastically with a stronger curriculum to keep
      even the youngest students engaged.  Make more use of video for science instruction
      in the high school."

    - "Chris Anderson is the Editor and Chief of Wired Magazine.  Anderson has written
      two books that examine the impact of the Internet on traditional business models.
      \ Anderson has his B.S. in physics.  Prior to coming to Wired, Anderson served
      as the U.S. Business Editor for the Economist.  Prior to that he wrote for two
      prestigious science journals, Nature and Science.\r\n\r\nIn Free, Anderson notes
      that unlike products and services in the physical world that inflate in cost
      over time, digital content and services actually deflate in cost and eventually
      approach zero over time.  He draws the analogy to Moore's Law, that states that
      \ computing capacity will double every 18 months.  This increase in capacity
      is accompanied by a similar decrease in price.  For instance, in 1961 a single
      transistor cost $10.  Today a single chip holds 2 billion transistors and costs
      $300.  Thus, the cost of a single transistor is too little to price.  What was
      once scarce is now abundant.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of bandwidth and memory has
      made the cost of storing and distributing content extremely low.  This has encouraged
      amateurs, as well as professionals, to become content creators.  This, in turn,
      has led to an abundance of content, most of which is free.\r\n\r\nAnderson observes
      that although the music and publishing industries have attempted to combat the
      free distribution of content through technological and legal barriers, Abundance
      creates a gravitational pull on prices that eventually approaches zero.  Artificial
      barriers cannot stop this force.\r\n\r\nAnderson contends that this is not necessarily
      a bad thing.  He provides examples of several successful business models that
      incorporate the free distribution of digital content and services.  The first
      example involves the original Monty Python team.  Noticing that they were losing
      money from people downloading and sharing videos of their work, the group decided
      to take things into their own hands.  They informed their fans that they would
      no longer tolerate the pirating of their work, so they were going to provide
      free, high-quality clips themselves for free.  In return they expected their
      fans to click on the ads on their site and to purchase their DVDs.  In two-months
      time, the sale of their DVDs had risen 34,000 percent.\r\n\r\nThe key to making
      money while providing content and services for free is to attach paid programs
      and services to them.  For instance, Second Life provides virtual tourism for
      free.  However, if you want to own property or premium content, you must pay
      a fee.  Valuable Open Source software is free, but many businesses, such as
      IBM, make a sizable profit by offering development and support for a fee.  Google,
      the largest provider of free content and services, makes money by attaching
      advertising to its searches that is directly targeted to the particular person
      conducting the search.\r\n\r\nAnderson notes that the monetary market is only
      one aspect of the overall economy.  In fact, other economies exist as well that
      are based on other measures of value.  These include the \"Attention\" and \"Reputation\"
      Economies.  We have all been told at some time in our lives that there is nothing
      more valuable than our \"Reputation\" and the large amount of money that we
      pay celebrities gives some indication of how much we value \"Attention.\"  Reputation
      and attention are two of the most important currencies on the web.\r\n\r\nFor
      each of the business models that Anderson presents, he provides an analysis
      of a company that uses it.  Each analysis breaks down the cost of providing
      the content and exactly how the company generates revenue to pay for the service
      without attaching a fee.\r\n\r\nNote: Readers can receive an abridged audio
      copy of the book for free at the Web Address provided above."

    - Why Your World is About to Get a Whole Lot Smaller
    - "Jeff Rubin served as the Chief Economist for the CIBC World Markets for almost
      20 years.  He was the first to accurately predict the rise in oil prices in
      2000 and is recognized as an expert in the field of energy.\r\n\r\nIn his book,
      Rubin contends that the depletion of oil reserves coupled with increasing demand
      will soon lead to triple digit oil prices and seven dollar prices for gasoline
      at the pump. The author provides much data to support his claim.  \r\n\r\nThe
      world loses approximately 4 million barrels of oil per day due to depletion.
      \ New reserves being exploited, such as the Calgary oil sands and deep off-shore
      wells require much greater energy to exploit, which reduces the actual yield.
      \ Deep off shore wells also tend to deplete much faster than on-shore reserves.\r\n\r\nWith
      regard to demand, although the use of energy in the US and other OECD nations
      has improve dramatically, the overall consumption of oil has actually increased.
      \ Since 1975, the US has decreased the number of barrels of oil needed per GDP
      by 50%, but has actually increased consumption by 40%.  This is what Rubin terms
      the rebound effect.  More efficiency leads to greater consumption as nations
      seek to expand their economies.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the demand for oil
      on the part of developing nations, many of which are OPEC nations themselves,
      is growing dramatically.  The higher standard of living that these nations enjoy
      leads to an increasing number of automobiles and other technologies requiring
      energy.  Thus, nations that previously exported most of their oil now retain
      a larger portion for their own needs.  In the case of Saudi Arabia this problem
      is exacerbated by the region's shortage of water.  This has led to the need
      for desalinization plants that require enormous amounts of energy.\r\n\r\nRubin
      predicts that when the current recession ends, the cost of a barrel of oil will
      once again reach triple digits.  This will be reflected at the gas pump in the
      US by $7 per gallon prices for gasoline. The result of this, according to Rubin,
      will be an end of globalization because people will be unable to afford travel
      for business or pleasure. The cost of shipping goods around the world will be
      too great, so manufacturing will return to where the products are sold.  Just
      in time inventory will also be too expensive, so warehouses full of stock will
      once again become the norm.  Global branding will diminish and products will
      become customized to local needs and preferences.  Technological innovation
      will slow because there will be a decrease in specialization.\r\n\r\nRubin observes
      that, \"We are liberal and tolerant because we are prosperous...As our economies
      grow, so does our sense of responsibility for others...As our economic well-being
      deteriorates, will we continue to remain committed to those principles of freedom
      and tolerance?\""

    - The Test of Our Times
    - "In his book, Tom Ridge, the former Governor of Pennsylvania and the first Secretary
      of the Department of Homeland Security, describes the challenges faced in forming
      a new cabinet-level department charged with keeping America safe. He describes
      how the new department had few resources at the beginning, but had to mobilize
      immediately since America faced imminent threats.  He describes how dedicated
      people worked tirelessly while having to scrounge for basic supplies. These
      people developed effective strategies and organizational structures despite
      logistic, political and organizational hurdles.\r\n\r\nRidge describes the difficulties
      encountered when trying to work with Congress and other members of the administration.
      These included turf protection, a reluctance to communicate and a predisposition
      in Washington to do things the way they have always been done.\r\n\r\nBased
      upon his experience, Ridge identified several needs that he believes are essential
      to keeping America safe and prosperous.  These include the ability for organizations
      at all levels to communicate and collaborate openly with one another.  The need
      for America to foster good relations globally and to develop a better understanding
      of other cultures.  The need for America to develop an immigration policy that
      removes onerous restrictions on visas and foreign workers, while maintaining
      secure borders.  The need for America to reassert itself as the leader in innovation.
      The need for America to secure its assets in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nMany of the
      needs identified by Ridge are consistent with those commonly called 21st Century
      Skills. I believe his observations have clear connotations for the nation's
      public schools."

    - Digital Barbarism
    - "In the spring of 2007, Mark Helprin published an OpEd piece for the New York
      Times that posited that copyright should be extended far beyond the current
      limit of 70 years after the death of the author.  Helprin noted that the fruits
      of his labor, unlike those of other people, would be taken from his children
      within their life time.  He reasoned that if the architect of a successful business
      bequeaths ownership to his heirs, the benefits of ownership do not expire after
      70 years, so why should it be so for an author.\r\n\r\nHelprin assumed that
      his OpEd piece would receive little notice or interest among the readers of
      the New York Times.  Much to his surprise, the piece actually set off a firestorm
      with three-quarters of a million \"hits\" all of which, according the Helprin,
      were negative.\r\n\r\nThis event led to Helprin writing Digital Barbarism, which
      uses copyright as the centerpiece around an argument that pits individualism
      against collectivism.  Throughout the book, Helprin reiterates the injustice
      of authors not being able to secure ownership of their work for their progeny.
      \ Unfortunately, most of the book degenerates into an often incoherent rant
      against higher education, public education, publishers, youth, computers and
      modernity.  Helprin's descriptions of education and society resonate like the
      musings of one who has read about a world that he has never actually visited.\r\n\r\nFor
      instance, Helprin places much of the blame for the embrace of open source and
      the Creative Commons at the feet of public education.  Helprin states that schools
      today prize collaboration, rather than individual achievement. He states, \"Students
      gather and 'brainstorm' (a comic-book word) to decide topics and approaches.
      \ They submit their work to what are in essence factory-floor soviets...as if
      they were composing essays in a luxurious Vietnamese reeducation camp.\"\r\n\r\nHelprin's
      disdain for his critics from higher education is evident in his referencing
      articles from the \"Chronicle of [Supposedly] Higher Education.\"  He compares
      wiki builders to Soviets and describes \"bloggy-type wikis\" as analgous to
      \"spitting on the street.\"\r\n\r\nHelprin rebukes those who idolize \"The Macine.\"
      \ He notes that some who, \"lap at the first trickles of what is new even have
      a name.  They are called \"early adapters.\"  From Helprin's description of
      this hapless group, one must conclude that he is actually referring to \"early
      adopters.\"  One is also left with the impression that he has never actually
      met one, but he knows all about them.\r\n\r\nOne of the last chapters is devoted
      to dispelling the myth of \"Convergence.\"  Helprin explains that this is an
      \"all explanatory unified field theory in physics; of the notion that the sexes
      will merge into one; of the quest for a single instrument embodying all convenience
      technologies; of the desire for a world government\" etc.  Huh?  I thought the
      Unified Theory of Physics had to do with resolving conflicting laws and properties
      that exist between quantum and classical physics. One might assume that Helprin
      is actually referring to the \"Singularity\" theory promoted by Ray Kurzweil,
      a researcher and writer in the area of Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\r\nOf education,
      Helprin writes, \"If our teachers scoff at dividing their subject matter into
      history, literature, and science, and wade instead into an amorphous 'interdisciplinary'
      bouillabaisse that relieves them of the responsibility of knowing what they
      are talking about...it is because we lack the discipline, focus, and clarity
      required to make refusals, maintain divisions, and uphold distinctions.\"  Clearly,
      Mr. Helprin does not recognize that it takes a far deeper understanding of one's
      discipline to be able to see points of intersection with other disciplines than
      simply to become an insulated expert (see Chris Mooney, Unscientific America,
      2009)."

    - The Laws of Disruption
    - "Larry Downes is a consultant and author who specializes in information technology
      and law.  He is a non-resident fellow of the Stanford Law School Center for
      Internet and Society.\r\n\r\nDownes identifies nine \"Laws of Disruption.\"
      \ The overarching law, however, is: \"Technology changes exponentially, but
      social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally.\"  Thus, as technological
      capabilities and resources expand, the systems used to manage the physical world
      are increasingly inadequate to manage the digital world.\r\n\r\nDownes explains
      that the Law of Disruption along with two other principles contribute to the
      \"power and potential of digital life.\"  The other principles are Moore's Law,
      which states that every 18 months the processing power of computers doubles
      while the price remains constant, and Metcalf's Law, which states that the usefulness
      of a network grows exponentially in relationship to the number of users connected.\r\n\r\nThe
      economics of information, Downes illustrates, runs counter to the normal rules
      of economics in the physical world.  For instance, value in the physical world
      is determined by supply and demand.  Scarcity leads to higher value.  Goods
      are divided into two categories, according to Downes, rivalrous and non-rivalrous.
      \ Rivalrous goods can be possessed by only one person at a time.  When they
      are depleted, they are gone.  Non-rivalrous goods can be used by everyone at
      the same time.  In the physical world, non-rivalrous goods tend to be services
      such as national security or military services.\r\n\r\nDownes identifies five
      principles that characterize information as an economic good.  He notes that
      they run counter to many of the traditional principles of economics.  They are:\r\n1.
      Renewability - Information cannot be used up.\r\n2. Universality - Everyone
      can use the same information at the same time.\r\n3. Magnetism - The value of
      information increases exponentially as more people access and use it.\r\n4.
      Lack of Friction - The more easily information is disseminated the more its
      value increases.\r\n5. Vulnerability - The misuse of information can destroy
      its value.\r\n\r\nThe nine Laws of Disruption are:\r\n1. Convergence - the border
      between the physical and digital worlds is blurring.  This has led to difficulties
      in interpreting and managing business practices and private life.  In business,
      law suits have become a means of trying to slow things down by competitors,
      which has also discouraged innovation in some instances.\r\n\r\n2. Personal
      Information - Information technology has made access to personal information
      easier.  While this has created great concern, especially with regard to identity
      theft, the truth is that the incidence of individuals experiencing financial
      harm from the breech of personal data is very small.  The primary way that identity
      theft occurs is still related to physical mail services.  Downes notes the \"Privacy
      Paradox,\" which is the dichotomy between the concern people express about protecting
      their personal information and the lengths that they go to give it away.\r\n\r\n3.
      Human Rights - Modern technology raises many questions regarding individual
      rights to privacy and property. Downes recounts some of the ways that technology
      has been used by the government for surveillance and raises questions about
      property rights as they relate to digital information and content.  The author
      also dispells some urban myths regarding individual rights.\r\n\r\n4. Infrastructure
      - The rapid deployment of high-speed networks throughout the world has led to
      conflict and confusion as regulators, such as the FCC have tried to apply laws
      and regulations to new technologies that were not even conceived of when the
      laws were first passed. Downes expressed particular concern over the \"Net Neutrality\"
      furor, which he contends was a \"Tempest in a Teapot\" since none of the practices
      that the Act was designed to regulate actually existed at the time.\r\n\r\n5.
      \ Business - Business practices in the digital age have proven to be the most
      perplexing as the government has tried to apply Antitrust laws designed to regulate
      railroads and utilities to digital programs and services.  This has proven most
      difficult with regard to software, which clearly benefits from integration.
      \ Downes cites the Microsoft antitrust case as the most vivid example.  Downes
      notes that in many cases antitrust cases have been filed simply to slow a competitor
      down.  He states that they have been extremely costly and have stifled innovation.\r\n\r\n6.
      \ Crime - Cyber crime, including such things as cyber bullying, is a very real
      problem.  Downes notes, however, that the biggest threat is that legislators,
      who do not understand the nature of the technology or the crime, tend to react
      in a knee jerk fashion, creating laws that do not ameliorate the problem, but
      result in collatoral damage to other positive aspects of digital life.  Downes
      posits that most of the crime can be most effectively addressed by industry
      and the digital community.\r\n\r\n7.  Copyright - Copyright poses one of the
      most perplexing and troubling issues in the digital age.  Although originally
      intended to protect artistic and literary works, copyright has been expanded
      to include other digital media as well.  Downes notes that Copyright was initially
      intended to provide creators with an opportunity to recoup transaction cost
      and thus encourage greater creativity and innovation.  With the highly diminished
      transaction costs associated with digital content, Downes states that the length
      of copyright protection should be reduced.  Instead it has been extended to
      70 years past the death of the owner, which Downes feels runs counter to its
      intent.\r\n\r\n8.  Patent - Since the dawn of the digital age, there has been
      a surge in patent applications.  This surge has overwhelmed those charged with
      evaluating the application and consequently has resulted in the erroneous award
      of volumes of patents.  With digital products, patent protection becomes extremely
      difficult because most programs in the digital age share at least some of the
      same code.  Digital products build upon one another.  A particularly nefarious
      outgrowth of the digital age are \"Patent Trolls.\"  These are businesses that
      buy up patents with no plan to actually implement them.  They then wait for
      opportunities to sue companies that actually manufacture products that may have
      features covered by the patent, even though they were created entirely independently.
      \ The most notable case involved the RIM Blackberry.\r\n\r\n9.  Software - Because
      of the low marginal costs for distributing software and the extremely short
      shelf life, assigning value and cost is very difficult.  Downes describes how
      this has led to the \"Open Source\" movement that provides software for free
      and accrues revenue through value-added services.  With regard to software,
      Downes proclaims, \"Open always wins.\"\r\n\r\nDownes concludes, \"the core
      principles of public law, private law, and information law are being turned
      upside down.  Policymakers from the physical realm have increasingly less influence
      in digital life, while consumers, both individually and in virtual groups, have
      correspondingly more.\""

    - Idiot America
    - "Charles Pierce is a staff writer for the Boston Globe Magazine.  He also contributes
      to several other publications including Exquire, American Prospect and Slate.\r\n\r\nAccording
      to Pierce, he became motivated to write \"Idiot America\" after visiting the
      Creation Museum in Hebron, Kentucky.  What struck Pierce most profoundly was
      a display in which a dinosaur wore an English Saddle.  Another display depicted
      Noah loading his Arc.  Again dinosaurs could be found among the herd of animals
      seeking refuge from the Great Flood.\r\n\r\nAs the title suggests, \"Idiot America\"
      is a humorous look at a very serious topic.  Pierce discusses how knowledge
      and expertise have been devalued in American society today in favor of religious
      and political dogma.  While the Creation Museum provides a somewhat humorous
      example, Pierce also highlights other examples that have much more serious implications
      for America and the world's future.\r\n\r\nThe author describes a visit that
      he made to a Shishmaref, Alaska, a village of around 500 on an island in the
      Chukchi Sea.  The island is disappearing due to the melting of the permafrost
      and rising of the sea.  The state of Alaska is already making plans to evacuate
      the village, which will take years.  In the meantime, the residents are building
      sea walls to stem the inevitable.\r\n\r\nPierce notes that evidence of the impact
      of climate change is clearly visible in such places as Shishmaref.  He also
      points out that the scientific community has reached consensus on the fact that
      much of the change is due to human activity.  Yet, a large segment of the US
      population chooses to ignore or deny these facts and align themselves with special
      interest groups that offer no real alternative.\r\n\r\nPierce contends that
      America has always been a society that tolerates \"Cranks\" well.  By Cranks,
      he means people with outlandish ideas based on little other than there own imagination.
      \ He cites examples such as conspiracy theorists, UFO chasers and others with
      fantastical beliefs.  The problem, Pierce maintains, is that these \"Cranks\"
      have now begun to command mainstream prominence.  Rather than serving as outliers
      on the border of serious thought, modern day \"Cranks\" have harnessed the power
      of technology to disrupt respectful discourse, discredit expertise and frame
      \ radical views as rational.\r\n\r\nPierce states, \"In the new media age, everybody
      is a historian, or a scientist, or a preacher, or a sage.  And if everyone is
      an expert, then nobody is, and the worst thing you can be in a society  where
      everybody is an expert is, well, an actual expert.\"  Pierce identifies \"Three
      Great Premises of Idiot America:\" 1) Any theory is valid if it sells books,
      soaks up ratings or otherwise moves units. 2) Anything can be true if someone
      says it loudly enough. 3) Fact is that which enough people believe.  Truth is

    - The Nature of Technology
    - "W. Brian Arthur is a leader in the fields of technology, economics and complexity
      science.  He has served as a Morrison Professor of Economics and Population
      Studies at Stanford and Citibank Professor at the Sante Fe Institute.  He currently
      is in residence at PARC.\r\n\r\nIn the Nature of Technology, Arthur examines
      how Technologies evolve within the economy.  Arthur contends that the economy
      is an expression of its technologies.  This, he points out, runs counter to
      the perspective of some economists who believe that the economy drives technology.
      \ Arthur supports his argument by providing extensive examples of how technologies
      have evolved over time and transformed the economy, rather than vice versa.\r\n\r\nArthur
      explains that technologies emerge and evolve in response to two stimuli, phenomena
      and need.  Arthur uses the development of the Turbo Jet to illustrate how both
      interact.  \r\n\r\nThe Wright Brothers did not have a \"need\" to fly when they
      designed their plane.  Their experiment grew out of their belief that flight
      was possible because they observed the phenomena of propulsion and lift when
      air was streamed across fixed wings.  Once planes came into existence, however,
      the need for faster planes that could fly higher emerged.  This led to another
      fundamental element of technological evolution, \"combination.\"  Engineers
      and inventors designed new component technologies that were combined with existing
      flight technologies.  This resulted in a deepening of structure and an increase
      in complexity.  The outcome was the jet engine. \r\n\r\nThe impact of air travel
      on the economy has been immeasurable.  Thus, it provides solid support for the
      contention that technology drives the economy.\r\n\r\nArthur, like others, observed
      that while technology may evolve relatively quickly, its adoption sometimes
      takes decades.  He suggests that this is due to man's relationship with nature.
      \ Man, Arthur notes, trusts nature.  On the other hand, Man places his hopes
      in technology.  He does not, however, trust technology, especially when it seems
      to be challenging nature, such as with genetic engineering.  Thus, man places
      his hope in something that he does not entirely trust.  This leads to significant
      dissonance.\r\n\r\nArthur also discusses the process of innovation that is so
      closely tied to the evolution of technology.  He states, \"The type of mastery
      you find in a Maillart bridge does not come out of 'genius.' More than anything
      it comes out of an accumulation of knowledge and expertise slowly gathered over
      years.\"  He goes on to say, \"experience with different solutions and subsolutions
      steadily cumulates and technologies change and improve over time.  The result
      is innovation.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the creative heart of invention lies appropriation,
      some sort of mental borrowing...\"\r\n\r\n\"Real advanced technology...issues
      not from knowledge but from...'deep craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Systems in the future...will
      be self-assembling, self-healing, and self-protecting.\" \"These are biological
      words.\" \"...as technology becomes more sophisticated, it is becoming more
      biological.\""

    - Denialism
    - "Michael Specter is a writes about science, technology and public health for
      the New Yorker Magazine.  He has won the Global Health Council's Excellence
      in Media Award twice and has won the American Association for the Advancement
      of Science's Science Journalism Award.\r\n\r\nAs the title implies, Specter
      examines how special interest groups in the United States have chosen to reject
      scientific breakthroughs in recent times despite overwhelming empirical evidence
      that these advances could solve some of the gravest problems facing mankind.
      \ \r\n\r\nSpecter begins by establishing a rationale for why some people may
      distrust science and scientists.  For this he uses the case of Vioxx as an example
      of how some science-based companies have betrayed the public's trust with the
      result of growing cynicism among the population.  This has, in turn, provided
      opponents of progress in other areas of science with the opportunity to exploit
      this fear and distrust.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest threats to public health that
      Specter identifies is the growing opposition to vaccinations championed by autism
      groups and some high-profile celebrities and politicians.  Specter cites numerous
      large-scale studies conducted by different research groups around the world
      that have looked at the issue and notes that no study has ever found a relationship
      between autism and vaccinations.  None-the-less, these groups dismiss the research
      and continue to assert their claim.  This has resulted in children not being
      vaccinated and the return of some highly-contagious diseases that had almost
      been eradicated.\r\n\r\nBio-engineered food represents another area where research
      has consistently demonstrated only positive effects, but still groups and even
      governments strongly oppose its use.  Specter notes that many in the sub Saharan
      regions of Africa, where there is not enough soil or water to grow adequate
      crops, suffer hunger and malnutrition that could be averted by the use of bio-engineered
      food products, but these are being withheld irrationally.\r\n\r\nOn the other
      hand, Specter points to the huge alternative medicine and supplement market
      in the US where many of the products that are heralded as miracle cures have
      been proven to have not positive effect whatsoever. Despite this, proponents
      angrily dismiss these studies and continue to spend fortunes on homeopathic
      medicines.\r\n\r\nMore frightening than the rejection by some of the findings
      of scientific research was the fact that researchers in some cases had to fear
      for their safety because their findings did not agree with beliefs of some of
      the more radical groups.  College professors and government researchers often
      had to have armed guards at their homes and offices for protection."

    - 'Googled: The End of the World as We Know It'
    - "Ken Auletta is a columnist for the The New Yorker Magazine.  His column, \"Annals
      of Communications,\" focuses on the new communications media.\r\n\r\nGoogled,
      as the name implies, tells of the rapid rise is size and stature of Google.
      \ Auletta introduces us to the two founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, whose
      passion to devise the best search tool possible led to a company that has revolutionized
      how the world gets its information.\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing a search
      tool that has enabled users to find information on almost any topic in seconds,
      Google has disrupted a wide-range of traditional industries.  Through the development
      of online services such as AdWord and AdSense that directly link advertisements
      to search terms and web content, Google engineers have brought a level of efficiency
      to advertising that threatens traditional broadcast models.  By charging only
      when the viewer actually clicks on the advertiser's link, Google has changed
      the economic model as well.\r\n\r\nThrough the development or purchase of other
      online programs, Google has disrupted other industries including film, television
      and print media.  With the purchase of YouTube, Google incurred charges of copyright
      infringement from the television and film industries.  Most notably, Viacom
      filed a $1 billion lawsuit in 2007 against Google.  Google contended that since
      it does not post content itself to YouTube and since it immediately deletes
      copyright protected content when informed of an infraction, it is covered by
      the \"Safe Harbor\" provision of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998.\r\n\r\nGoogle's
      plan to digitize \"all of the books in the world\" also has led to conflict
      with publishers and authors.  In 2008, however, Google came to an agreement
      with the U.S. publishing industry when it agreed to pay for past copyright infringements
      and also to purchase future content.  News publications have also expressed
      dissatisfaction with Google's news aggregation sites, claiming that Google is
      profiting from their content without paying for it.\r\n\r\nAs Google moves into
      other areas such as Cloud Computing, Mobile Telephony and Social Media additional
      conflicts can be anticipated.  Auletta contends that much of the conflict that
      Google has experienced thus far can be attributed to naivete.  He believes that
      Brin and Page, believing that bringing information to the world in the most
      efficient manner was good, failed to appreciate the legal and economic ramifications.\r\n\r\nSome
      interesting facts and stats:\r\n\r\n1. In 2008, Google's ad revenues matched
      the total ad revenues of the five broadcast TV networks.\r\n2. It took Microsoft
      15 years to reach $1 billion in revenues.  It took Google six.\r\n3. Piper Jaffray
      projected that consumers would download $2.8 billion in applications to their
      cell phones in 2009 and $13 billion by 2012.\r\n4. In early 2009, Amazon reported
      that 10% of the books they offered in print and for download were downloaded
      to Kindles.  By May of that year the number had risen to 35%.\r\n5. 15 hours
      of video content is uploaded to YouTube every minute.  That translates to 86,000
      full-length movies every week."

    - The Element
    - "With Lou Aronica.  Sir Ken Robinson is an internationally acclaimed expert
      on creativity and innovation.  Robinson contends that to be successful and fulfilled,
      one must find that activity that inspires passion within them.  Throughout the
      book he provides examples of people who have achieved remarkable success, often
      late in life, after finding and pursuing their passion.  Ideally, one can turn
      their passion into a career.  If this is not possible, however, many pursue
      their passion through an avocation.  This has become more prevalent and possible
      with the advent of the Internet.\r\n\r\nRobinson notes that more often than
      not, people choose careers that do not align with their Element.  This happens
      due to a host of personal, social and cultural constraints such as familial
      and societal expectations and values that do not accept one's personal interests
      to be worth pursuing. \r\n\r\nRobinson contends that education often poses the
      greatest barrier to young people developing and pursuing their passions.  This
      is due largely to a culture that values conformity, linear thinking and the
      regurgitation of facts.  Robinson observes that the recent standards movement
      and No Child Left Behind have exacerbated the problem by narrowing the curriculum
      in such a way that the arts, music and other creative disciplines have been
      reduced or eliminated.  This, the author believes, serves as a great threat
      to the U.S. and other western nations as they try to compete in a global economy
      that values creativity and innovation. \r\n\r\nRobinson concludes his discussion
      stating, \"The future of education is not in standardization but in customizing;
      not in promoting groupthink and 'deindividualization' but in cultivating the
      real depth and dynamism of human abilities of every sort.\""

    - The Essential Engineer
    - "Henry Petroski is the Aleksandar S. Vesic Professor of Civil Engineering and
      a history professor at Duke University.  He has written more than a dozen other
      books.\r\n\r\nIn the Essential Engineer, Petroski explains the importance of
      engineering in solving the complex problems facing the world today such as climate
      change, scarce energy resources and pollution. Petroski notes that society often
      looks to science to solve these problems, but Petroski contends that science
      alone cannot hope to achieve the solutions required.  Science, according to
      Petroski, studies what is.  Engineering, on the other hand, creates that which
      does not currently exist.\r\n\r\nPetroski's frustration at the inadequate respect
      given to engineers was evident throughout the book.  More importantly, however,
      was his observation that confronting complex problems requires a true multidisciplinary
      approach.  Petroski argued that scientists, engineers, medical experts and policy-makers
      must learn to cooperate and work together in order to solve these problems.\r\n\r\nAnother
      interesting observation with implications for educators was that many organizations,
      including the federal government, are abandoning the typical Request for Proposals
      process in favor of issuing direct challenges, with prize money attached, to
      anyone wishing to try to solve a particular problem or develop a particular
      device.  This has proven successful and may change the nature of competition
      for contracts in the future, pitting amateurs, individuals and teams against
      large corporations."

    - Cyber War
    - "Richard Clark served in a variety of national security roles within the administrations
      of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  He currently
      teaches at the Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. While working
      within the administrations of four consecutive presidents, Clark was responsible
      for coordinating Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter Terrorism
      programs.\r\n\r\nAs the title implies, Cyber War looks at the growing threat
      to our national security posed by \"Cyber Warriors\" and \"Cyber Criminals.\"
      \ Clark explains that although recent announcements by the US Military might
      lead one to believe that the US was gearing up for cyber war, in fact, the US
      has been out in front in planning cyber attacks on other nations should hostilities
      arise.  These efforts, however, have concentrated on offensive measures not
      on the defense of our own infrastructure. They have also lacked coordination
      with the Navy, Air Force and National Security Agency all having different approaches
      and objectives.\r\n\r\nCyber defensive measures have focused entirely on government
      networks and have left the nation's infrastructure, such as the power grid and
      air traffic control system, to the private sector to secure.  Clark views this
      as a huge threat that could bring our nations' economy and security to its knees
      almost instantaneously.  Clark notes that there has been extensive penetration
      of the US network infrastructure by other nations, most notably China.  This
      has resulted in the copying of enormous amounts of information and data.  He
      also notes that logic bombs have been discovered in the software that manages
      the US power grid.  These could be accessed later, through \"trap doors.\"  When
      activated these logic bombs would execute commands to destroy the power grid.
      \ Clark believes that these bombs were placed by China and may have been intended
      to be discovered to alert the US to China's capability should the US choose
      to intervene on behalf of Taiwan.  Clark points out that the US has used similar
      strategies to intimidate foes in Iraq.\r\n\r\nAlthough the US leads in offensive
      capabilities with regard to Cyber Warfare, it is also the most vulnerable to
      attack.  The vulnerability derives from the fact that the US is the most technologically
      dependent country in the world and becoming more so every day.  It is also one
      of the only countries that leaves the defense of its vital infrastructure to
      private corporations.  This, in turn, leads to inconsistent standards and a
      lack of a cohesive defense strategy.\r\n\r\nClark urges that several steps be
      taken to protect the US against cyber attack.  First, he believes that the US
      must develop standards and a strategy for protecting its vital infrastructure,
      most importantly the power grid.  Other \"just in time\" components of the supply
      chain must also be hardened against attack.  The US and other technologically-advanced
      nations must begin negotiating treaties and agreements to manage the threat
      of cyber war.  Clark compares these to the treaties signed by Russia and the
      US to limit the expansion of nuclear weapons during the cold war.  Finally,
      Clark recommends disconnecting vital security networks from the Internet.  He
      notes, however, that this is extremely difficult.  Even with an \"air gap\"
      between the network and the Internet, many security breaches are likely to occur
      as people move data from secure networks to computers used at home, to mobile
      devices etc."

    - Success through Failure
    - "Henry Petroski is a professor of Civil Engineering and history at Duke University.
      \ He is the author of numerous books on engineering and design.\r\n\r\nIn Success
      through Failure,as the name suggests,Petroski demonstrates how many of the greatest
      achievements in design have grown out of failures.  The key to successful designs,
      whether they be bridges or marketing strategies, is the ability of the designers
      to either learn from prior failures or to anticipate failure based on their
      experiences.  The author states, \"Failures are remarkable.  The failures always
      teach us more than the successes about the design of things.\"\r\n\r\nPetroski
      contends that how a person reacts to failures determines whether they are a
      leader or a follower, a designer or a mere user.  He further states that while
      understanding failure is the path to success, success is often the path to failure.
      \ The author notes, \"...victory can be an intoxicant.  Pride in the new successful
      thing typically turns in time to nonchalance, as the once-revolutionary thing
      becomes a common thing.  Common things virtually become invisible things.\"
      \ Petroski provides numerous examples of engineering designs involving bridges
      and skyscrapers where the extension of successful designs eventually led to
      catastrophic failures because of complacency and the expectation of success.\r\n\r\nRelated
      to the vulnerability generated by success, Petroski cites research that has
      shown that catastrophic failures with regard to bridge designs tend to occur
      in 30 year cycles.  Other research has revealed this same phenomenon in other
      areas, as well.  Petroski posits that this could be due to a \"generational
      gap\" where the success of certain designs has become so accepted that new professionals
      entering the field no longer question their appropriateness for new applications
      and assume success without considering elements that might lead to failure under
      new circumstances.\r\n\r\nPetroski quotes the English biologist T.H. Huxley,
      \"There is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures early in
      life.\"  Petroski concludes warning that we must be wary of the \"lure\" of
      success lest we miss the \"lessons\" of failure."

    - Change By Design
    - "Tim Brown is the CEO of IDEO.  IDEO is a consulting firm focusing on Industrial
      Design that Business Week identified as one of the 25 most innovative companies.\r\n\r\nChange
      by Design describes how the process of \"Design Thinking\" can be applied to
      any organization, program or process to spur innovation and to add value.  Brown
      provides examples of how IDEO has worked with large and small companies to bring
      \ cost-effective solutions to improve products and/or to meet basic human needs
      in highly impoverished areas.\r\n\r\nUnlike the traditional analytical approach
      to problem-solving, Design Thinking utilizes a divergent model.  Design Thinking
      begins with the user.  Much like an anthropologist, the designer observes and
      records the user as he or she goes about his or her daily activities.  This
      often reveals needs that might not be apparent through interviews or traditional
      marketing research.  Brown notes that \"empathy\" is a key skill of the designer.\r\n\r\nBrown
      stresses that design  is a participatory process. Users must be engaged and
      have input throughout the process in order for it to be successful. This is
      consistent with Tapscott's observations in \"Wikinomics\" that today's consumers
      wish to  participate in the development and customization of products.  Tapscott
      christened this new breed of consumers, \"Prosumers.\"  \r\n\r\nBrown contends
      that the participatory culture needs to extend beyond the marketplace to every
      service area, particularly  education.  He calls for a \"participatory\" teaching
      and learning environment that encourages divergent thinking and creativity;
      a learning environment that encourages risk taking and embraces failure. To
      this end, Brown cites the IDEO motto, which is \"Fail early to succeed sooner.\"\r\n\r\nDesign
      thinking requires careful consideration as to the total experience of the user
      rather than simply the end product.  It is the overall experience that determines
      a user's satisfaction with a product or a service not just its effectiveness."

    - Drive
    - "In Drive, Daniel Pink cites extensive research supporting the fact that intrinsic
      motivation is far more powerful than extrinsic motivation in promoting the creative
      type of work required in the economy today. Pink reviews the history of motivational
      theory going back to Frederick Taylor.  The author cites several studies that
      found that Taylor's Carrot and Stick approach actually has a negative effect
      on employee motivation in today's workplace. Extrinsic rewards, Pink points
      out, were more suited for the boring, repetitive factory work prevalent in Taylor's
      day.\r\n\r\nPink identifies \"Seven Deadly Flaws\" associated with Carrots and
      Sticks.  They can:\r\n1. Extinguish intrinsic motivation,\r\n2. Diminish performance,\r\n3.
      Crush creativity,\r\n4. Crowd out good behavior,\r\n5. Encourage cheating, shortcuts,
      and unethical behavior,\r\n6. Become addictive,\r\n7. Foster short-term thinking.\r\n\r\nDespite
      the research showing the lack of effectiveness of extrinsic motivators, businesses
      continue to rely on them, often through the use of performance goals.  Pink
      quotes a group of scholars from the Harvard Business School, Northwestern's
      Kellogg School of Management, the University of Arizon's Eller College of Management
      and the Wharton School who state, \"Goals may cause systematic problems for
      organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking,
      decreased cooperation, and decreased intrinsic motivation.\"\r\n\r\nPink uses
      the metaphor of a software upgrade when calling for a move from Type X, extrinsic
      motivators,  to Type I, intrinsic motivators by businesses.  He cites three
      elements for intrinsic motivation:\r\n1. Autonomy\r\n2. Mastery\r\n3. Purpose\r\n\r\nThe
      ability to feel in control of one's own work contributes greatly to intrinsic
      motivation.  Pink describes how several successful companies, such as Google,
      provide time for employees to choose and work on their own projects.  \r\n\r\nThe
      second element, Mastery, refers to the desire of most employees to get better
      and better at a task that they view as important.\r\n\r\nFinally, the sense
      that one's efforts are for a greater cause is essential to intrinsic motivation.
      \ This sense of \"purpose\" provides context for the work."

    - Collider
    - "Collider is the story of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  The book provides
      a history of the evolution of high-energy physics culminating in CERN's construction
      of the underground Large Hadron Collider, which spans the border between Switzerland
      and France.  Although the researchers are conducting a variety of experiments
      using the LHC, the primary goal is to expose the Higgs Boson, or god particle.
      \ This theoretical particle is believed to have provided all other particles
      in the Universe with their mass.  \r\n\r\nScientists believe that the identification
      of the Higgs Boson could provide the link needed to resolve the laws of classical
      physics and quantum mechanics. By smashing protons and other particles at extremely
      high-speeds, the researchers plan to collect the debris, which hopefully will
      include the Higgs Boson.  This could shed light on the how the four forces (weak,
      strong, magnetic and gravitational) all interact.\r\n\r\nWhile U.S. Scientists
      play an important role in the LHC research, the LHC marks the first major project
      in high-energy physics that has not been the initiative of the United States.
      \ While the U.S. still maintains an active high-speed collider, Congress decided
      to pull the funding for the building of a new collider in 1993. Since that time,
      the U.S. has ceded the leadership role in high-energy physics to other nations.\r\n\r\nCollider
      also dispels myths associated with the LHC such as the contention that it might
      create black holes that could consume the earth. Any such black holes that might
      be created would not have enough gravitational pull to extend beyond the nucleus
      of a single atom.  They would also decay and be propelled into space almost
      instantly.\r\n\r\nA few interesting facts:\r\n\r\n1.  Particles did not combine
      to form atoms until 300,000 years after the Big Bang.\r\n2.  Data from the LHC
      is disseminated to thousands of scientists throughout the world almost instantly
      over the \"Grid\" to allow rapid analysis.\r\n3.  Luminous matter (everything
      composed of atoms) makes ups only about 4% of the Universe's contents.  23%
      is comprised of dark matter and 73% is composed of dark energy."

    - The Shallows
    - "\"The Shallows\" grew out of an article that Carr wrote for the Atlantic magazine
      entitled, \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\" The article appeared in the July/August
      2008 edition.\r\n\r\n\"The Shallows\" provides an in-depth examination of the
      impact of the Internet on one's intellectual functioning and the physiology
      of one's brain.  Carr reviews the growing body of research that supports the
      plasticity of the brain.  This research, which includes direct physical and
      empirical evidence, overturns the classical belief that the brain, and for that
      matter intelligence, is fixed early in life.  Classical brain theory contends
      that once the brain reaches maturity, it loses the ability to grow new cells
      and adapt to new demands. From the point of maturity, which occurs early in
      life, the brain embarks on a downward spiral where cellular death occurs with
      increasing frequency, but cerebral adaptation and repair ceases to be possible.\r\n\r\nRecent
      research demonstrates that the mature brain can and does adapt to new environments,
      demands and challenges. New medical imaging technology allows researchers to
      observe and document significant changes in brain activity induced by external
      stimuli or physical trauma.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the above research for
      Carr's argument is that the Internet, and specifically the use of hypertext,
      has significantly changed the way that humans ascertain, process and use information.
      \ Having established the plasticity of the brain and the impact of tools on
      the brain, Carr then reviews a history of literacy from the very earliest of
      times.  \r\n\r\nAs would be expected, Carr identified one of the most significant
      milestone in evolution of literacy as the printing press.  This not only led
      to the democratization of reading and writing, but it also led to the introduction
      of books.  Books, in turn, allowed readers to access the printed word efficiently
      for extended periods of time.  This resulted in the development of \"deep reading\"
      skills, which increased the reader's ability to concentrate for long periods
      of time.  This eventually changed the \"vital pathways\" in the brain of the
      readers.\r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that reading on the Internet is very
      different from reading printed works.  In particular, Carr notes that hypertext
      presents the readers with constant interruptions that prevent \"deep reading.\"
      \ MRIs suggest that the brains of subjects engaged in \"deep reading\" vs. reading
      on the Internet actually process the information differently.  The constant
      \"surfing\" on the Internet leads to a more superficial or \"shallow\" reading
      experience.\r\n\r\nCarr also addresses the contention by some educators and
      authors that the Internet obviates the need for memorization.  Carr contends
      that memorization has been viewed as an essential skill throughout history.
      \ It's value is not so much the information that one commits to memory, but
      the fact that memorization trains the brain to move information from short to
      long-term memory in an efficient manner.  Carr views the Internet as a threat
      to this ability as well.\r\n\r\nCarr is not a technophobe or technology hater.
      \ He actually is a power user who obviously loves to surround himself with the
      tools that he says pose such a threat.  He does not suggest that technology
      will or should be curtailed, but rather discusses the threat in an even-handed
      and sincere way."

    - Leaders Make the Future
    - "Bob Johansen has worked as a forecaster for 35 years.  He served as the president
      of the Institute for the Future from 1996 to 2004.  He is the author of numerous
      books and consults with businesses and non-profits.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for
      the Future produces 10 year forecasts to assist business and policy leaders
      in decision-making.  The current forecast predicts unprecedented change that
      will require new and very different leadership skills.  Johansen adopts an acronym
      used by the Army War College, \"VUCA,\" to describe to describe the world in
      which we live.  \"VUCA\" stands for \"Volatility,\" \"Uncertainty,\" \"Complexity,\"
      and \"Ambiguity.\"  By developing ten essential skills, Johansen contends, leaders
      can transform the \"VUCA\" world.\r\n\r\n#1 The Maker Instinct: A move from
      a \"Do it yourself\" attitude to a \"Do it ourselves\" attitude.  The modern
      leader must embrace collaboration and cease to view competition as a zero sum
      game.\r\n#2 Clarity: The ability to see beyond the messes and contradictions.
      \ Leaders must have a clear vision of what they want to achieve, but have great
      flexibility in how to achieve it.\r\n#3 Dilemma Flipping: The ability to transform
      dilemmas, which cannot be solved, into opportunities.\r\n#4 Immersive Learning
      Ability: The modern leader recognizes the need for continuous learning.  He
      or she must take advantage of modern technologies that can provide experiential
      learning opportunities.  These include virtual reality simulations and games.\r\n#5
      Bio-empathy: The ability to learn from nature.  The modern leader observes and
      learns from the patterns of nature.  Johansen strongly believes that the next
      big economic driver will come from biology and the Life Sciences.\r\n#6 Constructive
      Depolarizing: Technology has led to virtual \"diasporas\" or groups. Historically
      \"diasporas\" have involved displaced people with a common ethnic or cultural
      background.  In today's world, virtual diasporas have emerged that join people
      not by nationality or ethnicity, but by interests, attitudes and beliefs.  This
      has led to a growing polarization within society.  The successful leader, must
      be able to work with these groups and bring them together in constructive pursuits.\r\n#7
      Quiet Tranparency: The ability to be open and honest about your values without
      becoming pretentious.  This seems very similar to the leadership quality described
      by Jim Collins in Good to Great.\r\n#8 Rapid Prototyping: The ability to learn
      from failure quickly. The modern leader must view failure as the road to success.
      \ He or she must encourage rapid development and testing, rather than extensive
      planning, to reduce the cost of failure.\r\n#9 Smart Mob Organizing: The modern
      leader must be able to take advantage of Crowd Sourcing through technology as
      exemplified by Innocentive and other crowd sourcing sites.\r\n#10 Commons Creating:
      The leader must understand how to create a platform where individuals and groups
      can build for the greater good.\r\n\r\nQuote: \"You cannot listen for the future
      if you are deafened by the present.\""

    - The Little Book of String Theory
    - "Steven Gubser is a professor of Physics at Princeton University.  The Little
      Book of String Theory is part of the Science Essential Series that is intended
      to bring key scientific concepts and theories to the general public.\r\n\r\nScientists
      hope that String Theory will unify the laws of quantum mechanics and gravitational
      force.  In so doing, String Theory seeks to become the \"Theory of Everything.\"\r\n\r\nGubser
      introduces the major components of String Theory such as branes, strings, string
      dualities, symmetry and supersymmetry and how all of these relate and interact
      to form and sustain the seen and unseen universe.\r\n\r\nGubser describes the
      subatomic world of quarks, gluons, fermions, and hadrons.  He then explains
      how scientists hope to identify these and possibly new, unknown particles during
      experiments currently being conducted in Geneva using the Large Hadron Collider.\r\n\r\nWhile
      Gubser kept his promise and avoided complicated mathematical formulas in his
      explanations, this was still a very technical and difficult book to understand
      for the lay reader.  The constant introduction of new terms used to describe
      theoretical particles existing within an environment of 11 and possibly 26 dimensions
      proved challenging."

    - Why does E=mc2 (and why should we care?)
    - "Why does E=mc2 was co-authored by Jeff Forshaw.  Brian Cox is a professor of
      particle physics at the University of Manchester.  Jeff Forshaw is a professor
      of theoretical physics also at the University of Manchester.  As the title suggests,
      the purpose of the book was to explain the relationship between mass and energy
      and the practical significance that it holds for our future.\r\n\r\nThe Cox
      and Forshaw provide a historical perspective on how Einstein developed his most
      famous equation.  Although the authors structure their explanations for the
      non-mathematicians among us, they do provide sufficient detail for the mathematically
      proficient to understand how the formula's evolve.\r\n\r\nThe authors begin
      by describing how scientists of the 19th Century made landmark discoveries through
      experiments that could easily be conducted on a work bench.  Today, they observe,
      it takes 10,000 scientists and engineers collaborating at CERN to conduct experiments
      using machines that span miles.\r\n\r\nYet, the authors are also careful to
      note that none of the dramatic breakthroughs in physics, even those by such
      luminaries as Einstein, evolved in isolation.  They all grew from the collective
      work and vision of many theorists going back as far as Galileo.\r\n\r\nCox and
      Forshaw's explanation of why the speed of light (\"c\" in the formula) serves
      as the cosmic speed limit.  Using a mathematical proof, the authors demonstrated
      that if this was not the case, then the whole concept of causality would breakdown
      and effects would be able to precede causes.  This would violate a universal
      law of physics.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of how Einstein came to realize that \"Space\"
      and \"Time\" were interrelated again required some mathematical explanation.
      \ Understanding this served as a prerequisite for understanding the relationship
      between matter and energy. The recognition of spacetime established the speed
      of light as a universal constant.  Unlike time and distance when measured separately,
      the speed of light does not change based upon the movement or location of the
      observer.  With the speed of light serving as a constant, the direct relationship
      of mass to energy became apparent.\r\n\r\nThe authors spent considerable time
      discussing the four forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational.
      \ Using Einstein's formula we know that everything that has mass has energy.
      \ The authors also provided a mathematical proof that showed that even particles
      without mass could have energy if they travel at the speed of light.\r\n\r\nBased
      on Einstein's equation, we know that all matter stores energy. Quantum Theory
      tells us that left alone heavier things tend to change into lighter things if
      at all possible and the law of energy conservation tells us that energy is conserved.
      \ This can be expressed through an extension of the original equation to E=mc2+1/2mv2
      where v stands for velocity.  This equation depicts the release of some of the
      potential energy in matter, but conserves it as kinetic energy (1/2mv2).\r\n\r\nSo
      one has to ask, with all of this energy captured all around us, how can there
      be an energy crisis?  That introduces the second theme of the book, \"why should
      we care?\"\r\n\r\nMuch of the research and experimentation described in this
      book was conducted as \"pure\" research.  While the research has enables space
      travel, GPS satellites, MRI machines, etc., the researchers did not envisions
      those applications.  They merely wished to understand how the Universe worked.
      \ Continued research in high-energy physics, while expensive and esoteric, holds
      great promise to help us understand how to unleash the abundant energy around
      us in a controlled and productive way.  \r\n\r\nThe study of quantum mechanics
      has debunked many long-held beliefs.  It has shown that the way the world works
      at the subatomic level is often counter intuitive to our observations of world
      around us."

    - Don't Be Such a Scientist
    - "Randy Olson received his Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University.  He then
      served as a tenured professor of marine biology at the University of New Hampshire.
      \ At the age of 38, Olsen gave up his professorship and went to the University
      of Southern California School of Cinema where he earned an M.F.A.\r\n\r\n\"Don't
      Be Such a Scientist\" begins with Olsen being humiliated in front of a class
      of young drama students by a world famous acting instructor.  The professor
      shouted at Olsen during an improv sketch where he a young female student insulted
      his baldness.  Olsen reacted rationally, rather than emotionally.  This outraged
      the instructor prompting her to scream, \"You cannot, I repeat cannot, come
      into this classroom and have not feelings.\"  She went on, \"That is what intellectuals
      do.  They intellectualize the world.  They suck the life out of life.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough
      painful, this led Olson to examine his personal style of communication.  He
      had always been successful in the scientific world, but now he saw how ineffective
      he had become in trying to communicate with a broad audience.\r\n\r\nAs a marine
      biologist who had observed first-hand the spectacular beauty of the oceans.
      \ He had grave concern at the impact that pollution, climate change and other
      environmental hazards were having on the the oceans.  Of even greater concern
      was the lack of concern on the part of the general population.  This led Olson
      to investigate how these troubling facts were communicated by scientists to
      the non-scientific community.  He concluded that scientists failed miserably
      in this essential task and that their scientific training had actually prepared
      them to be poor communicators.\r\n\r\nOlson's training in cinematography led
      him to realize that communicating to a mass audience is very different from
      communicating with people who share a similar knowledge-base or background.
      \ He developed, what he refers to as the \"Four Organs Theory\" for connecting
      with a large audience.  The four organs referred to in the Theory are the mind,
      the heart, the gut and the sexual organs.  Olson contends that as the appeal
      of one's message moves lower in the body the larger the audience that it engages.\r\n\r\nThe
      mind - A message that appeals only to the mind can hope to appeal to a very
      small group of intellectuals.  These messages tend to be fact-laden, impersonal
      and cautious.  Unfortunately, most of the communication from the science community
      is restricted to this organ.\r\n\r\nThe heart - Messages from the heart tend
      to be full of passion.  Religious messages appeal to the heart rather than the
      head.  In general people respond more favorably to messages from the heart than
      merely from the mind.\r\n\r\nThe gut - Messages from the gut are generally laced
      with humor and intuition.  These are more basic in nature and prone to appeal
      to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nSex Appeal - Not all messages can be sexy, but those
      that are tend to appeal to just about everyone.  Advertisers try to add sex
      appeal to everything from cars to soap.  The purpose of adverting is to reach
      the largest audience possible and adding sex appeal is a proven strategy.\r\n\r\nOther
      key ideas from \"Don't Be Such a Scientist:\"\r\n\r\n1.  The key to effective
      mass communication, \"Arouse and Fulfill.\"\r\n2.  Storytelling allows you to
      arouse and fulfill simultaneously.\r\n3.  Attackers of science offer a great
      opportunity.  They add tension and conflict to the story.\r\n4.  Style becomes
      more powerful than substance in communicating with a large audience.\r\n5.  \"Mass
      movements can arise and spread without a belief in a God, but never without
      belief in a devil.\""

    - "Rutger Van Santen is an award-winning computational catalytic chemist who is
      a professor and former rector magnificus of the Eindhoven University of Technology.
      \ He is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and a
      foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.\r\n\r\nDjan Khoe
      is a co-author of \"2030.\"  Khoe is a Professor of Electro-Optical Communications.
      \ He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and
      the Optical Society of America.\r\n\r\nBram Vermeer is a freelance science journalist
      who has written about technology for Dutch newspapers and scientific journals
      for the past 25 years.  Vermeer maintains a website where much of the research
      used for 2030 can be accessed.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, \"2030\" deals with
      the major challenges that mankind will face over the next 20 years.  The authors
      identify the following: 1) malnutrition, 2) drought, 3) cancer 4) infectious
      diseases, 5) care of the elderly, 6) cognitive deterioration, 7) climate change,
      8) depletion of natural resources, 9) natural disasters, 10) educational deprivation,
      11) habitable cities, 12) financial instability, 13) war and terrorism, and
      14) infringement on personal integrity.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the world's
      deaths, according to the authors, during the early 21st Century have been due
      to malnutrition.  Lack of water also continues to be a problem for large portions
      of the earth's population.  This is not because rain is scarce, but that it
      is unequally distributed.\r\n\r\nBased on predictions by climatologists, the
      unequal distribution of rainfall could be exacerbated by climate change.  Van
      Santen, et.al. note that we may be reaching a tipping point with regard to climate
      change.  In fact, the authors speculate that we may have already passed the
      tipping point for the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic ice.\r\n\r\nThe need for
      renewable energy resources relates to several of the major challenges.  Finding
      new, renewable energy sources is essential to: mitigate climate change, bring
      deprived areas out of extreme poverty, promote financial growth and stability
      and cut off income to terrorist groups.  The authors identify three elements
      that must by considered when seeking alternative energy: concentration, storage
      and transportation.  They refer to this as the \"energy triad.\"\r\n\r\nThe
      authors discuss several of the most promising alternative energy sources.  None
      appear capable of replacing the dependency on petroleum alone.  Most promising
      among the candidates is geothermal since it is largely untapped, offers a tremendous
      amount of energy potential and is found throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThroughout
      the book, the authors discuss how technology can help to address the challenges
      faced by mankind.  In the area of manufacturing, the authors suggest that the
      use of Microplants.  These can build objects at the molecular level, which could
      eliminate pollution and the need for vast distribution networks.  The use of
      small monitors and cellular level technologies could help to fight disease and
      provide greater independence for the elderly.  They could also be used more
      effectively to mitigate natural disasters.\r\n\r\nWith regard to communications
      technology, the authors suggest that we may be nearing the end of our ability
      to shrink microprocessors.  The conversion from electronic to optical switches
      could increase speeds and reduce size, but this appears to be unlikely in the
      near future.\r\n\r\nThe authors contend that in order to meet the challenges
      that they identified, mankind must learn to manage failure more effectively.
      \ They note that currently the U.S. loses approximately $55 billion annually
      just in the failure of computer-related projects.\r\n\r\nThe threat of Pandemics
      also poses a major challenge for mankind.  At the present time, 85% of American
      Pharmaceuticals are manufactured outside of the U.S. and there is only enough
      oil to last six days.  With the disruption that a major pandemic could cause,
      this would prove devastating.  In order to avoid shocks on the scale of a pandemic,
      the U.S. must decrease its global dependency.\r\n\r\nThe authors view education
      as essential to meeting the challenges mankind will face over the next two decades.
      \ They state, \"A world order is emerging that is characterized by connectivity,
      change and convergence.\"  Students must learn to deal with complexity from
      the earliest grades on.  Unfortunately, education usually stresses simplicity.
      \ What students need, however, is the ability to see the interrelationships
      among things and a better understanding of the complexity of technology and
      society.\r\n\r\nSchools need to develop individuals \"who are able to absorb
      knowledge to understand the background and context of the issues and who generate
      new knowledge and understanding.\"  The linear transfer of knowledge does not
      develop such individuals.\r\n\r\nThe authors address the problems faced by cities.
      \ They note that at a time when people have the greatest ability to connect
      no matter where they are located, cities have experienced their greatest growth.
      \ While this is counter intuitive, it is consistent with the economy of scale
      and economy of accelerated productivity identified by Luis Bettencourt.  These
      laws state, respectively, that the larger the city, the more efficient the physical
      infrastructure and as the size of a city doubles, the productivity of individual
      residents increases by 15%.  Thus, as technology increases the pace of productivity,
      people move to more urban centers, which can support the pace."

    - Macrowikinomics
    - "Co-Author: Anthony D. Williams.\r\n\r\nMacrowikinomics is an expansion on the
      Authors first book \"Wikinomics,\" which was published in 2006. In \"Wikinomics,\"
      the authors described how the social trend toward mass collaboration through
      the use of web 2.0 and other social media tools was forever changing the way
      that products and services were designed and produced.  In \"Macrowikinomics,\"
      the authors contend that this has now expanded to impact every aspect of society.\r\n\r\nThe
      authors identify five principles of Macrowikinomics.  These are: 1. Collaboration,
      2. Openess, 3. Sharing, 4. Integrity and 5. Interdependence.  Tapscott and Williams
      provide numerous examples of how successful businesses and other organizations
      have adopted these five principles to overcome problems, develop innovative
      products and contribute to the well-being of the world.\r\n\r\nThe authors suggest
      ways that governments could use the principles of Wikinomics to engage citizens
      in solving both domestic and global problems including climate change, rapidly
      depleting natural resources and health care.  Creating tools that enable individuals
      to better monitor their personal health, could lead to reduced health care costs.
      \ Providing businesses and citizens with tools to better monitor compliance
      with environmental and trade regulations could reduce the cost of enforcement
      while increasing regulatory control.  Establishing a commons where companies
      could share research, educators could share resources and individuals could
      share needs and solutions could lead to a more efficient and innovative society.\r\n\r\nTapscott
      and Williams also acknowledge the \"Dark Side\" of Macrowikinomics.  They note
      that some in society worry that mass collaboration leads to average, rather
      than exceptional, performance.  The authors counter this argument with numerous
      examples of innovative breakthroughs made possible by massive collaboration.\r\n\r\nTapscott
      and Williams agree that the ubiquitous sharing of personal information on social
      networking sites presents a legitimate danger and a loss of privacy.  The authors
      reference a 2010 study by the Pew Institute, however, that found that twenty-year-olds
      tend to protect their personal information on social networking sites more than
      older adults.  The authors contend that this demonstrates that the younger generation
      is adapting to the new collaborative world and taking the measures necessary
      to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts and figures from the book:\r\n\r\n1.
      \ In 2009, the U.S. spent 17.3% of GDP on health care.  That is more than it
      spent on food.\r\n2.  The average high-energy physicist now has 173 collaborators.\r\n3.
      \ Thirty percent of the energy consumption in Germany, Denmark and Spain comes
      from Green Energy."

    - "Michael Fullan is professor emeritus at the Ontario Institute for Studies in
      Education at the University of Toronto.  Fullan consults with political and
      educational leaders throughout the world.  He is a respected researcher and
      expert in the area of educational change theory.\r\n\r\nIn \"All Systems Go,\"
      Fullan contends that true change in education requires that all systems from
      state to district to local schools must share the same moral purpose and commitment.
      \ Fundamental to this process is a focus on \"collective capacity\" building.
      \ Collective capacity yields emotional commitment and technical expertise that
      exceeds anything possible through the development of individual capacity.  \r\n\r\nBuilding
      collective capacity requires everyone within the system to form a community
      of learners.  Teachers and administrators set goals, analyze data and make instructional
      decisions together.  Everyone within the system learns from each other regardless
      of hierarchical status.  Members of the system may engage in \"collaborative
      competition,\" but always are willing to share and help one another.\r\n\r\nFullan
      stresses that clear and shared goals are necessary to achieve positive change.
      \ He cautions, however, that the number of goals and standards must be focused
      and limited.  A small number of worthy goals can elicit a shared moral purpose.
      \ Moral purpose, the author explains, consists of \"raising the bar, closing
      the gap and clear, uplifting standards and expectations for all.\"\r\n\r\nFullan
      warns against over planning and over selling reform.  He notes that \"actually
      accomplishing something is the best incentive for doing more of it.\" \r\n\r\nAnother
      key component of the All Systems Go model is \"Intelligent Accountability.\"
      \ Unlike the punitive accountability that typifies current educational models,
      Intelligent Accountability: 1. Relies on incentives rather than punishment,
      2. Focuses on capacity building to enable people to achieve the goal, 3. Invests
      in collective responsibility, 4. Initially, maintains a nonjudgmental perspective,
      5. Utilizes a transparent approach to data regarding results, and 6. Intervenes
      decisively when necessary.\r\n\r\nFullan concludes by reinforcing the fact that
      focusing on individual capacity, which is the prevalent approach to educational
      reform, can never result in systemic change.  The author points to the growing
      support among policy makers for \"merit pay\" as an example of an ineffective
      strategy.  Fullan states categorically that, \"no research exists that demonstrates
      that widespread benefits derive from merit pay.\" Its focus on individual capacity
      and its lack of moral purpose make it a poor motivator for change.  \r\n\r\nWhile
      building individual capacity is important, it must be preceded by the development
      of collective capacity.  It is through the collective capacity of the system
      that individual capacity increases."

    - Motion Leadership
    - "Motion Leadership is a short book that serves as a complement to Fullan's \"All
      Systems Go\" treatise on systemic educational reform.  Motion Leadership provides
      the \"Skinny\" on how to become a savvy change leader.  According to Fullan,
      before one can introduce change it is essential to establish personal relationships
      through listening, empathizing and developing a rapport with the members of
      the group with whom you are working.\r\n\r\nAs the name of the book implies,
      Motion Leadership, is predicated on action.  Fullan expands upon the \"Skinny\"
      metaphor warning against Fat Plans.  He cites Doug Reeves, who wrote in 2009,
      \"the size and prettiness of the plan is inversely related to the quality of
      action and the impact on student learning.\"  Fullan urges those interested
      in systemic education reform to adopt a \"Ready, Fire, Aim\" approach.  He states
      that a those involved in the change process should learn about implementation
      during implementation and stresses that risk-taking is essential to successful
      learning organizations\r\n\r\nFullan warns that change leaders should avoid
      overselling reform prior to implementation because communication without action
      means \"practically nothing.\"  In fact it can  prove counter productive in
      the beginning of the change process that is generally characterized by an \"Implementation
      Dip.\"  If the leader has over hyped the reform, this can lead to discouragement
      among the participants and threaten the overall success of the change initiative.\r\n\r\nA
      key component of the change process is collaboration among all involved.  Fullan
      states that top-down change doesn't work and bottom-up change hasn't proven
      successful either.  He contends that peer interaction is the \"social glue\"
      that keeps the change process moving forward in a focused and cohesive manner.
      \ Collaboration leads to \"Collective Capacity Building,\" another key component
      of the change process.\r\n\r\nOther elements that are fundamental to the success
      of a change initiative include transparency and trust.  Transparency refers
      to the honest sharing of data reflecting practices and results.  Trust, Fullan
      tells us is built upon two ingredients, integrity and competence.  Those leading
      the change process must exhibit honesty, reliability and sincerity.  They must
      also prove that they have the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve the
      prescribed goals."

    - The Art of Immersion
    - "Frank Rose is a contributing editor for Wired magazine.  He writes about the
      entertainment industry.  The Art of Immersion describes how technology and the
      digital age have transformed the art of story telling from a passive activity
      on the part of the reader/listener to an immersive experience in which the reader/viewer/listner
      becomes part of the story.\r\n\r\nRose describes how today's storytellers utilize
      a variety of different media in order to tell their story. He describes how
      the producers of The Dark Knight engaged viewers and heightened anticipation
      of the release of the movie through an Alternate Reality Game.  People all over
      the country were provided cryptic clues that sent them to bakeries where they
      provided a name that they had been given in exchange for a cake.  Inside each
      cake was a phone and a number to call.  As each clue was found it was added
      to a website.  Thousands of others, not directly associated with the game followed
      closely as the clues were revealed.  By the end, they realized that they had
      actually served unknowingly as henchmen of the Joker.  By the time the movie
      debuted, thousands in the audience were already part of the story.\r\n\r\nIn
      another example, Rose described how Betty Draper, a frustrated suburban housewife
      married to a 1969 advertising executive, posted a message on Twitter.  She shared
      that she was sitting on her back porch and opening jars of fireflies.  What
      was odd about this event was that Betty Draper was a fictional character from
      the television show Mad Men. Soon other characters from the show began adding
      Twitter posts that provided insights into their lives and personalities.  What
      was especially strange about all of this was that neither the producers of the
      show nor the network that carried it had anything to do with the Tweets.\r\n\r\nYoung
      readers of the Harry Potter series also jumped into the story they loved by
      creating Harry Potter fan websites throughout the web.  Unfortunately, Warner
      Brothers did not appreciate the fans' enthusiasm feeling that it impinged upon
      the intellectual property rights that it had purchased from J. K. Rowling.  The
      studio began sending the teens and tweens cease and desist letters.  One 16
      year old in Virginia took exception to the bullying of young children by a large
      studio.  She created an online organization called the Defense Against the Dark
      Arts and coordinated a boycott against Harry Potter merchandize.  Others around
      the world soon took up the cause and Warner Bros. eventually backed down.\r\n\r\nMost
      entertainment today engages the audience through various media including games,
      websites, movies and merchandize.  The popular TV show, The Office, created
      an online game where viewers could become part of the office staff and earn
      points that could be used to purchase virtual decorations for their desks.  Other
      programs create immersive virtual environments that allow the audience to experience
      the story through avatars.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Immersion provides another example
      of the participatory culture described by Tapscott in Wikinomics.  Yet, the
      art of storytelling has always been participatory in nature.  Even before books,
      storytelling was an art form in which the story teller shaped and shaded the
      story in his or her own special way."

    - Physics of the Future
    - "Michio Kaku is a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of
      New York.  Dr. Kaku also has a cable television show on the Science Channel.\r\n\r\nPhysics
      of the Future looks at likely scientific advancements that may take place during
      the balance of the 21st Century.  Kaku points out that all of his predictions
      are based on work currently being done in the area of science and technology.
      \ He draws on interviews and observations that he has conducted in conjunction
      with his research, writing and documentaries.\r\n\r\nKaku categorizes his predictions
      according to how close they are to being realized.  Each chapter is divided
      into the \"Near Future\" highlighting advances anticipated by 2030.  The \"Midcentury\"
      covers innovations possible between 2030 and 2070.  The \"Far Future\" suggest
      what might be available in the 2070 to 2100 time frame.\r\n\r\nKaku begins by
      describing the future of the computer.  He emphasizes how Moore's Law, which
      states that the power of a computer will double every 18 months, has transformed
      the world and the economy.  Kaku predicts that Moore's Law should begin to fail
      around 2020.  The potential impact on the economy could be devastating, but
      Kaku goes on to predict that chips will move away from Silicon to other materials,
      possibly DNA.  This could prolong Moore's Law far into the future.\r\n\r\nComputers
      will probably cease to exist as chips are embedded in every thing around us.
      People will view the Internet on wall screens, windows and even contacts. They
      will control the screens telepathically or through voice commands.  Our bathrooms
      will become labs that monitor our health and provide warnings of serious diseases
      years before they become health threats.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on Artificial Intelligence
      notes that while there have been significant gains in this area, it is not going
      to fully mature within the current century.  Robots, while becoming more prevalent
      and sophisticated, are not expected to become truly intelligent due to their
      inability to recognize patterns or exhibit common sense.  Human intelligence
      is expected to prevail well into the next century, but the increased capacity
      of robots should have a significant impact on jobs of the future.\r\n\r\nMedicine
      is on the threshold of tremendous advances that could lead to extended life
      spans and improved quality of life. Bioengineering and Stem Cell research is
      expected to allow organs to be regrown and malignant cells to be neutralized
      before they become dangerous. DNA mapping should lead to customized treatments.
      Advances in computing and nanotechnology promise to improve early detection
      and precision treatments.\r\n\r\nAdvances in alternative energy sources should
      lead to much greater availability and efficiency.  However, this is not expected
      to occur until mid-century when scientists finally learn how to generate power
      using fusion.  The continued use of fossile fuels in the mean time is expected
      to lead to climate change that will have an adverse effect on the planet.  Advances
      in transportation made possible through nanotechnology and computing, however,
      could reduce the effect by allowing vehicles to move over an electromagnetic
      field that eliminates friction and therefore substantially reduces energy consumption.\r\n\r\nSome
      of the extended predictions that Kaku mentions such as the \"Space Elevator\"
      seem like science fiction.  Yet, serious research into these resources currently
      is underway.  While space travel will become more pervasive, Kaku predicts that
      it will be done by tiny robots the size of a pin head rather than by humans.
      \ For the next century at least, Kaku predicts that man will be earth bound.\r\n\r\nThe
      implications of the above for careers and the economy are not surprising.  Those
      who perform tasks that involve creativity, innovation and common sense (judgement)
      should thrive.  Those who perform repetitive tasks or serve as a middleman are
      endangered.  Many blue collar jobs should continue to be valued by society.
      \ Kaku points out that trash collectors should be secure due to the fact that
      their jobs require pattern recognition and judgments based on the interpretation
      of what they perceive.\r\n\r\nFinally, by the end of the century, Kaku sees
      mankind moving towards a planetary civilization.  Nations are expected to exist,
      but mankind will approach life on a global, rather than local, scale."

    - Reality Is Broken
    - "Jane McGonigal is an author and researcher on game theory and gaming for the
      Institute of the Future.  She has been featured in the Economist, Wired and
      the New York Times.  Business Week named McGonigal one of the 10 top innovators
      to watch in 2009.  McGonigal received her PhD in Performance Studies from the
      University of California - Berkley.\r\n\r\nThe premise of Reality Is Broken
      is that the skills and attitudes that games evoke could and should be applied
      to real world endeavors.  McGonigal contends that games reflect what people
      want out of life: more satisfying work, better hope of success, stronger social
      connectivity, and the chance to be part of something bigger than themselves.\r\n\r\nThrough
      a series of fourteen \"Fixes,\" McGonigal demonstrates how the principles of
      game design could be applied to solve real world problems.  This, she suggests,
      would lead to greater focus, optimism and \"flow.\"  The author notes that game
      designers know how to \"inspire extreme effort and reward hard work.\"  They
      can \"facilitate cooperation and collaboration at previously unimaginable scales.\"\r\n\r\nThe
      first half of the book describes game design principles and compares these to
      how society and the contemporary work place approach problems and productivity
      issues. McGonigal then provides a fix for reality that incorporates the game
      design principles and explains how these could enhance life and work.\r\n\r\nThe
      second half of the book provides examples of games that have been developed
      to address  pressing social issues.  These include \"Free Rice,\" a casual game
      developed to help end world hunger and  \"Fold It,\" an online program that
      uses game design principles to engage people to solve protein folding puzzles.
      This, in turn, could speed up medical research that may some day  cure Alzheimers,
      cancer and other  diseases. \r\n\r\nMany of the games that McGonigal highlights
      are Alternate Reality Games or ARGs. These games bridge the gap between the
      game world and the real world.  They are being used extensively in the entertainment
      and marketing industries.  McGonigal suggests ways that they could also enhance
      learning and could be brought to bear on the most challenging problems facing
      the world today.\r\n\r\nMcGonigal discusses the \"Engagement Economy.\"  Today,
      she states, it is not enough to simply acquire people's attention.  People now
      want to be engaged.  This is consistent with Tapscott's \"Participatory\" culture.
      \ Game designers are experts at engaging players by providing voluntary epic
      challenges, feedback and opportunities for mass collaboration.  The author points
      out that game designers provide \"sustainable\" engagement opportunities because
      they rely on intrinsic, rather than extrinsic motivation and rewards.  This,
      she feels, is far superior to the extrinsic reward systems generally used to
      solicit effort and commitment in the \"Real World.\"\r\n\r\nWho plays games?
      \ A demographic breakdown:\r\n\r\n*69% of heads of households,\r\n*97% of youth,\r\n*40%
      of gamers are women,\r\n*25% are over the age of 50,\r\n*Average age is 35,\r\n*Most
      gamers expect to continue playing for the rest of their lives."

    - Where Good Ideas Come From
    - "Steven Johnson is the author of numerous best sellers.  He writes for Time,
      Wired, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. \"Where Good Ideas Come
      From\" examines the history of innovation.  In looking at innovation throughout
      the ages, the author analyzes the impact of the environment, individual inspiration
      and the competitive marketplace on innovation.\r\n\r\nJohnson introduces several
      interesting concepts that he suggests spur innovation.  One of the most fundamental
      concepts related to innovation is \"The Adjacent Possible.\"  The term the \"Adjacent
      Possible\" was first coined by the scientist Stuart Kauffman.  It refers to
      first order combinations that once made lead to other possibilities in a generative
      and exponential manner.  Johnson describes how life on earth began simply as
      a \"handful of basic molecules\" that collided to form other molecules that
      eventually led to the complex building blocks of life.  Within the Adjacent
      Possible framework, only certain outcomes are possible, but they grow with each
      new collision or combination.  In the case of life on Earth, the highly connective
      nature of carbon rapidly expanded the Adjacent Possible.\r\n\r\nThe Adjacent
      Possible for good ideas, or \"Innovations,\" density of ideas capable of colliding
      increases.  Johnson contends that that is why research has shown that the average
      person living in a city tends to be more creative than one living in a small
      town.  Johnson shows how demonstrates how the rate of life-changing innovations
      increased throughout history as people settled in cities.  \r\n\r\nThis trend
      has increased even more since the creation of the World Wide Web.  Johnson contends
      that the web has made it possible for people to share and grow ideas no matter
      where they live.  This has dramatically increased the Adjacent Possible.\r\n\r\nJohnson
      examines the role of the individual and group in the innovative process.  For
      the most part, Johnson posits, innovations have grown out of a collaborative
      process rather than an individual's inspiration.  To support this conclusion,
      the author analyzed major innovations introduced since 1600 to the present.
      \ In addition to classifying them as individual or networked accomplishments,
      he also classified them as either market or non-market driven.  From 1600 -
      1800 there was a relatively even split between individual and networked innovations.
      Almost all were non-market driven and were motivated by the passions and interests
      of the creators.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, however, there was a tremendous increase in
      innovation and a decided shift towards networked approaches.  This, of course,
      coincided with the industrial revolution and the growth of cities.\r\n\r\nAs
      the above suggests, Johnson examined the role of the marketplace in stimulating
      innovation.  He noted that most economists contend that it is the competitive
      market that spurs innovation.  Johnson acknowledged that many innovations have
      resulted due to the promise of monetary reward, but he also demonstrates that
      many of the most significant innovations have not been so motivated.  He states,
      \"...connectivity may, in the end, be more valuable to innovation than purely
      competitive mechanisms.\""

    - 'Bottled Lightening: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy'
    - "Seth Fletcher is a senior editor for Popular Science.\r\n\r\nBottled Lightening
      provides an excellent history of the development of the battery. Fletcher describes
      how the evolution of the battery has made the technology boom possible by making
      long-lasting energy possible.  He notes that with dwindling world petroleum
      supplies, global unrest and climate change, the need for alternative energy
      sources has become critical.  Without an efficient means of storing energy,
      however, the transition to alternative sources is not possible.\r\n\r\nMuch
      of Bottled Lightening focuses on the development of Electric Cars.  Fletcher
      notes that electric cars are not a new concept.  In fact, electric cars were
      available at the outset of the automotive industry.  The development of the
      internal combustion engine and the abundance of oil reserves obviated the need
      for electric cars and research and development ceased until recent decades.
      \ In the 70's during the oil embargo, GM began working on a new electric car
      called the EV1.  Although those who piloted it, were very enthusiastic, GM ceased
      the program when oil once again became available\r\n\r\nWith the development
      of lithium batteries, electric cars have once again become an area of significant
      research and development.  Many of the major car manufacturers around the world
      are introducing hybrid and electric cars.  GM has again entered the market with
      the Chevy Volt.  \r\n\r\nResearch into the development of more efficient and
      powerful batteries is also being spurred by the need to store energy generated
      for the power grid.  Batteries are needed to store energy generated by wind
      and solar sources. \r\n\r\nAs the energy market begins to move towards lithium
      rather than petroleum, a whole new supply chain has emerged.  With some of the
      largest lithium reserves being located in countries such as Bolivia, the international
      challenges may prove as daunting as with petroleum.  Many other countries, including
      the U.S. have large reserves, however, so availability should not prove a problem."

    - Living on the Future Edge
    - "Ian Jukes is an educator, consultant and author.  He is the founder and director
      of the InfoSavvy Group.  \"Living on the Future Edge\" was coauthored by Ted
      McCain, an award-winning author and Lee Crockett a designer, consultant and
      entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n\"Living on the Future Edge\" is a call to educators to
      restructure education to meet the current and future needs of their students.
      \ Jukes describes how society at large has been transformed by the pace and
      magnitude of technological change, but education has lumbered along largely
      unaffected.  The authors urge educators not to be paralyzed by their paradigm\r\n\r\nJukes,
      et al. urge educators to adopt the perspective of the quarterback who views
      the field with two screens simultaneously, the present and near future.  The
      quarterback knows that throwing the ball to where the receiver is can only result
      in an incompletion.\r\n\r\nJukes introduces four trends that have enormous significance
      for the students in today's schools.  These trends have increased the rate of
      change and have transformed the way that the world does business. It has had
      a fundamental impact on how individuals learn, play and communicate.\r\n\r\nThe
      trends include:  Moore's Law, Photonics, the Internet, and InfoWhelm.  The authors
      also discuss how disruptive innovations have led to the failure of many market
      leaders because they have refused to change their way of doing business.  Jukes
      et al. suggest that this could also happen to public education.\r\n\r\nThe book
      concludes with a discussion of education in the future and the new roles it
      will require educators to assume."

    - From Eternity to Here
    - "Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology.
      \ Carroll received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1993 and has taught at MIT, UC
      Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\n\"From Eternity to Here\"
      examines the \"Arrow of Time.\"  The \"Arrow of Time\" concept states that the
      Universe, and all things in it, move from a low entropy (highly organized) to
      a high entropy (highly disorganized) state.  This phenomenon represents the
      Second Law of Thermodynamics.  It is evident in the evolution of the universe
      as well as in the breaking of a dropped egg on the kitchen floor.  One of the
      characteristics of this evolution is that it is generally not reversible.  Once
      broken, it is difficult to recreate the original egg.\r\n\r\nCarroll begins
      with an explanation of the principle of \"SpaceTime,\" first formulated by Eistein
      in the Law of General Relativity.  While General Relativity provides a solid
      description of time experienced at the Macro level of life, Carroll and others
      believe that Quantum Mechanics holds the ultimate explanation for the Arrow
      of Time.\r\n\r\nTo fully understand the Arrow of Time one must understand the
      origin of time beginning at the Big Bang.  While scientists have a good understanding
      of the evolution of the universe from the period just after the Big Bang, they
      have little understanding of the universe right at the time of the Big Bang.
      \ Carroll notes that the essential question that theoretical physicists and
      cosmologists are trying to answer is, \"Why was the universe at the time of
      the Big Bang in such a state of low entropy?\"  To date, the answer to this
      question continues to allude scientists.\r\n\r\nSince the number of possible
      high entropy states far exceeds the number of possible low entropy states, Carroll
      suggests that the status of the early universe was very unlikely.  Rather than
      trying to explain the low entropy state of the early universe, some scientists
      have simply accepted it as a \"Boundary Condition.\"  Carroll views this as
      a cop out. While cosmologists have put forth a variety of possible scenarios
      for how the universe might have begun in such a low entropy state, none has
      risen to the status of a theory.\r\n\r\nFrom Carroll's point of view, the most
      promising of the current scenarios is that of a Multiverse.  In this model,
      the known universe is only one of many universes.  Each universe in the Multiverse
      evolves independently and is completely isolated from any other universe.  In
      the Multiverse model a given universe may spawn \"Baby Universes\" in a low
      entropy state.  The \"Baby Universe\" then separates and evolves from low to
      high entropy completely unaware of any other universe that might exist.\r\n\r\nThus,
      in a Multiverse model, the Big Bang does not represent the ultimate beginning
      of time.  Although it would be impossible for anyone from the known universe
      to discover anything prior to the Big Bang.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts:\r\n\r\n1.
      \ Up until the 1990's it was believed that the universe would eventually stop
      expanding and then collapse on itself in an event scientists called the \"Big
      Crunch.\"  That was disproven with the discovery that the expansion of the universe
      is actually accelerating due to \"Dark Energy.\"\r\n2.  Unlike other types of
      energy, \"Dark Energy\" does not dissipate or dilute as the universe expands.
      \ It remains constant.\r\n3. 80-90% of the mass that makes up the universe is
      dark matter, not made up of atoms and molecules.\r\n4. Atoms were not formed
      until approximately 400,000 years after the Big Bang."

    - 'The Master Switch: The Rise & Fall of Info. Empires'
    - "Tim Wu is a professor at Columbia University and a policy advocate.\r\n\r\nThe
      Master Switch examines the cycle that information industries tend to go through
      from open to closed systems.  Wu chooses several examples and demonstrates how
      each started out as an open system with a great deal of innovation but very
      little central control.  As they became more vital to the economy and lucrative
      to the investors, each became much more centrally controlled.\r\n\r\nTwo of
      the most vivid examples provided were Radio and the telephone.  In the early
      days of radio, like the early days of the Internet, radio was mainly of interest
      to hobbyists.  As the communications capability of radio became apparent, it
      came to be viewed as a national security asset.  The federal government, through
      the FCC, granted near monopoly control of the industry to RCA.  While this provided
      stability and reliability, it also led to RCA squelching major innovations such
      FM broadcasting for decades.\r\n\r\nThe history of the telephone was similar.
      \ In the early days, there were many small telephone companies, some of whom
      used fencing wire to connect farms.  When the FCC granted monopoly status to
      AT&T to develop the nation's phone network all of these entrepreneurs were driven
      out of business.  While AT&T succeeded in establishing the national phone network,
      it was not without cost.  AT&T  controlled every aspect of research and development
      and prohibited third parties from developing and attaching any ancillary equipment
      to the phone.  In one famous case, AT&T sued the manufacturer of \"Hush a Phone,\"
      a simple cup device intended to be attached to a phone to provide more privacy
      for the speaker.  Probably the most shocking example of suppression occurred
      when AT&T ordered that all research and development cease on the development
      of magnetic recording devices for the phone in the 1930's.  This delayed the
      introduction of the answering machine by approximately 60 years.\r\n\r\nThe
      movie industry provided another example of a highly centralized industry that
      started out free and open.  Eventually just a few large studios controlled everything
      from the studios, the stars, content and the movie theaters.  The result was
      a marked decrease in creativity and an increase in censorship.\r\n\r\nWu's thesis
      is that today's Internet, while arguably the most open information system in
      history, also is at risk to become controlled by just a few big players.  AT&T,
      Comcast and a few others control so much of the infrastructure that they could
      easily take control of the content and use as well.  This, Wu explains, is the
      crux of the net neutrality issue.  Wu cautions that highly popular companies
      like Apple could lead the way down this slippery slope.  Although founded as
      an open, creative enterprise, Apple has become a very closed, secretive company.
      \ The result has been the development of highly attractive, reliable and popular
      technologies.  Wu notes that this, however, has also yielded tremendous control
      to Apple and has stifled the work of third party innovators.  To use the metaphor
      implied by the title, Apple holds the Master Switch."

    - 'Linchpin: Are You Indispensible?'
    - "Seth Godin is an entrepreneur, best-selling author and highly sought-after
      speaker.  Godin holds degrees in computer science and philosophy and earned
      his MBA at Stanford.\r\n\r\nGodin proclaims at the beginning of Linchpin that
      each and everyone of us is a genius.  He challenges us to think of the times
      when we have experienced an insight or solved a problem that eluded everyone
      else. At these times, our inner genius momentarily emerged from within.  In
      most cases, unencouraged and uncultivated, it then quickly retreated to the
      inner confines of our being.\r\n\r\nOver time, Godin observes, social institutions
      such as schools, government and corporations, extinguish the genius and artistry
      within us in exchange for the perception of security and stability.  Society's
      suppression of our personal genius maintains a social and economic order developed
      during the industrial age.  A time when cheap, easily replaceable workers were
      needed to fill our factories and businesses.  Workers served as cogs on the
      wheel of industry and nothing more.\r\n\r\nToday's economy, however, rewards
      a different type of worker.  A worker capable of creativity, innovation and
      artistry.  These are the people who are indispensable.  They are the \"Linchpins.\"\r\n\r\nGodin
      is careful to point out that the artistry and genius exhibited by Linchpins
      are not reserved to esoteric pursuits.  Linchpins bring personal commitment
      and passion to a task, no matter how menial.  The Linchpin always seeks to bring
      about change that will improve a product, a situation or an experience.  The
      Linchpin is not afraid to explore new paths or accept new challenges despite
      ambiguity and uncertainty of success.  The Linchpin is a map maker.\r\n\r\nUnleashing
      one's genius and artistry requires great courage.  Many internal and external
      elements conspire to discourage both.  Godin refers to these collectively as
      \"the resistance.\"\r\n\r\nExternally, social institutions such as school, government
      and corporations encourage obedience and conformity.  They demand compliance
      and deference to authority.  These traits are antithetical to genius and artistry.
      \ They are an anethma to the Linchpin.\r\n\r\nInternal resistance, though, proves
      far more powerful in suppressing our willingness and ability to create and bring
      about change.  Fear of failure or ridicule inhibits many from taking the risks
      necessary to achieve their genius potential.   Godin notes that this fear has
      a physiological origin emanating from the most primitive parts of the human
      brain.  Godin calls this the \"Lizard Brain.\"\r\n\r\nOvercoming the resistance
      requires \"passion,\" a passion that makes facing the risk of failure, criticism
      and even ridicule worthwhile.  Overcoming the resistance requires significant
      emotional labor and a desire to bring about change that is so strong that one
      views it as a gift, not a transaction.\r\n\r\nAs an educator, I found Godin's
      indictment of education to be both disturbing and valid.  As education in America
      moves more and more towards standardization and punitive accountability, what
      is to become of our artists and geniuses?"

    - Knocking on Heaven's Door
    - "Lisa Randall is the Frank J. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University.
      \ Randall is a particle physicist and cosmologist.  She has written numerous
      journal and magazine articles.  She also is the author of \"Warped Passages:
      Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions.\"\r\n\r\nKnocking
      on Heaven's Door highlights the research currently being done in particle physics
      at the subatomic and cosmological scales.  In fact, the impact of scale serves
      as the unifying theme of Knocking on Heaven's Door.  Randall begins by highlighting
      one of the greatest mysteries facing physicists today, namely the fact that
      theories and laws that function consistently and predictably when investigated
      at the scale of the observable world simply do not hold true at the subatomic
      or quantum level.  Physicists are currently in pursuit of a unifying theory
      that would serve to explain this inconsistency.\r\n\r\nRandall suggests that,
      while such a unifying theory would be helpful, it is not essential.  The author
      observes that the laws of physics on the observable scale remain reliable and
      consistent.  When applied at this level, scientists and non-scientists alike
      can use them to make predictions and assumptions critical to everyday life.
      \ At the quantum mechanical level, other laws apply and can be used to make
      predictions and assumptions confidently.  As long as these laws remain reliable
      at the given scale, their value remains undiminished.\r\n\r\nRandall provides
      a first-hand description of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which she visited
      while it was still under construction.  As an internationally respected physicist,
      Randall was provided access to the entire structure.  The LHC is the most costly
      machine ever built.  It lies beneath the French-Swiss border and covers a distance
      of approximately 27km or 17 miles.  The LHC was built and is operated by CERN,
      the European Organization for Nuclear Research.  \r\n\r\nRandall provides an
      summary of the numerous investigations currently underway at the LHC.  The most
      notable investigation involves an attempt to identify the Higgs boson, which
      scientists believe is responsible for the formation of matter following the
      Big Bang.  Identifying this and other elusive particles requires the collision
      of subatomic particles, in this case protons, at extremely high energy.  It
      is hoped that these collisions will result in the formation of other subatomic
      particles such as the Higgs.\r\n\r\nThe LHC experiments serve as a bridge between
      the very small subatomic scale and the vast cosmic scale studied by cosmologists.
      \ The LHC experiments, especially the search for the Higgs Boson may explain
      much about how the universe was formed.\r\n\r\nMoving to the cosmic scale, Randall
      goes on to discuss the role that dark matter and dark energy play in the expansion
      of the universe.  While dark matter and dark energy have never been seen, their
      presence has been determined mathematically through the observation that the
      universe, rather than slowing down as formally predicted, is actually speeding
      up.  The expansion is uniform much the same as if one put dots on a balloon
      and then inflates it.\r\n\r\nRandall discusses other developing theories in
      cosmology including String Theory and the Multiverse Theory.  While not a String
      Theorist, per se, Randall and her colleague Raman Sundrum have proposed a theory
      to explain why gravity is such a weak force when compared to the other three
      forces (strong nuclear, weak and electromagnetic) encountered.  This has been
      a question that has historically puzzled scientists.  The Randall-Sundrum theory,
      based upon a solid mathematical foundation, contends that the gravitational
      force is actually commensurate to the other forces, but it is concentrated in
      another dimesion (Brane).  Adding a fifth dimension to Spacetime, would explain
      why we feel gravity as such a weak force.\r\n\r\nRandall concludes her book
      with an argument for the importance of basic scientific research.  While the
      goal of much of the research described in Knocking on Heaven's Door is simply
      to expand our knowledge of the world and the universe in which we live, Randall
      contends that it is essential.  She provides numerous examples of how knowledge
      gained from basic research has led to new technologies, such as the microcomputer
      chip, even though such applications were inconceivable at the time the research
      was conducted."

    - Steve Jobs
    - "Walter Isaacson is the CEO of the Aspen Institute.  He has also served as the
      chairman of CNN and the managing editor of Time Magazine.  Isaacson has written
      biographies of Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger.  Jobs repeatedly
      asked Isaacson to write his biography.  Jobs agreed to allow absolute access
      and would not read or comment on the biography until after it was published.
      \ He did, however, reserve the right to review and comment on the cover prior
      to publication.\r\n\r\nIn this biography, Isaacson interviewed family, friends,
      critics, competitors and partners of Steve Jobs.  He also reviewed news and
      magazine articles, books, emails and other artifacts that chronicled the evolution
      of Jobs throughout his life and career.  The biography provides a deeply personal
      as well as historical perspective on Steve Jobs and, to a lesser degree, Apple.\r\n\r\nThroughout
      this rather lengthy portrait, Jobs emerges as a complex and driven individual
      with an uncanny sense for design and marketing.  Although not particularly talented
      in the realm of engineering or computer science, he possessed a spectacular
      ability to identify and appreciate talent and potential.  \r\n\r\nJobs' passion
      for elegant design served as the catalyst for the success of Apple and Pixar.
      \ Small flaws that appeared irrelevant to others could drive Jobs to emotional
      tirades that often left those around him frustrated and angry.  Design, to Jobs,
      was a spiritual expression rooted deeply in the eastern philosophies that he
      embraced early in life.  He sought simplicity in every aspect of his products.
      This simplicity would speak to the end user's intuition rather than intellect.
      \ Early in the design of the Macintosh, for example, Jobs went to IDEO, a local
      industrial design company, to have them design a single button mouse that would
      work on any surface.  Jobs rejected the complexity of a multi-button mouse.
      \ IDEO succeeded in meeting Jobs' requirements and then went on to be one of
      the most innovative design firms in the world.\r\n\r\nIsaacson describes how
      Jobs' personal life, especially the realization that he was adopted, influenced
      his personal and professional life.  Although, raised by loving parents, parents
      whom Jobs certainly loved deeply, he still felt a sense of abandonment.  Ironically,
      he later abandoned his first daughter, born out of wedlock.  Despite numerous
      attempts, he was never able to reconcile with his daughter.  Jobs often displayed
      a selfish and self-absorbed personality, which made long-term relationships
      difficult.  None-the-less, he did have devoted family and friends.\r\n\r\nOne
      of Jobs' most pronounced characteristics was what others have termed his \"reality
      distortion field.\"  This enabled Jobs to dismiss limitations, which led to
      great accomplishments.  At the same time, it led him to ignore or reject realities
      such as the paternity of his first daughter and later, the seriousness of his
      illness.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Isaacson notes that the experience that most
      influenced Jobs' ultimate success was the failure of his second company NeXT.
      \ This led him to recognize that best products were not necessarily market successes.
      \ Jobs learned that his obsession with design could, in fact, lead to products
      that were more than the market could bear.\r\n\r\nThe biography of Steve Jobs
      described his ultimately unsuccessful bout with cancer.  In this case his strong
      personality and mystical beliefs may have led to his demise.  Having been diagnosed
      with a rare and treatable form of pancreatic cancer, Jobs chose not to have
      surgery, but attempted to treat the disease through diet and holistic means.
      \ Later, when he found that this was not working, he chose to have the surgery,
      but the cancer eventually spread leading to a liver transplant.  While this
      extended his life, he eventually succumbed to the disease.\r\n\r\nSome interesting
      facts:\r\n\r\n1.  In 1977 Apple was valued at $5,309.  By 1980, it was valued
      at $1.79 Million.\r\n2.  In May 2000, Apple's market value was one-twentieth
      of Microsoft's.  By May 2010, Apple had surpassed Microsoft as the most valuable
      technology company.  In September 2011, Apple was worth 70% more than Microsoft.
      \ And in February 2012, Apple stock was more valuable than Microsoft and Google
      combined, according to Complex.com.\r\n3.  Apple made 300 millionaires.\r\n4.
      \ At age 25, Jobs was worth $256 million.\r\n\r\nSome interesting quotes:\r\n\r\n1.
      \ \"Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing
      itself in successive outer layers.\r\n2.  \"You can't win on innovation unless
      you have a way to communicate to customers...\"\r\n3.  \"If you don't cannibalize
      yourself, someone else will.\"\r\n4.  \"I never rely on market research.  Our
      task is to read things that are not yet on the page.\""

    - The Quantum Universe:And Why Anything That Can Happen Does
    - "The Quantum Universe: And Why Anything That Can Happen Does, was co-authored
      by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw.  While a relatively short book, I found it to
      be very difficult to understand at times.  Cox and Forshaw set out to demonstrate
      the validity of many of the theories of Quantum Mechanics such as Heisenberg's
      Uncertainty Principle, Schroedinger's equation and Pauli's Exclusion Principle.
      \ While Cox and Forshaw were able to explain these theories clearly, the mathematical
      equations that they offered in proof were far beyond my skill level.\r\n\r\nOne
      interesting aspect to this book was the integration of chemistry and quantum
      mechanics.  This was necessary to understand the formation of matter.  The authors
      also provided some examples of how Quantum Mechanics impact our daily life,
      noting that it is the tendency for electrons to repel each other (Pauli's Exclusion
      Principle) that keeps us from \"falling through the floor.\"\r\n\r\nBecause
      of Uncertainty Principle, the authors stated that the study of Quantum Mechanics
      can never offer more than a set of probabilities.  Indeed, this is the very
      aspect of the study that led Einstein to scoff that \"God does not roll dice!\"\r\n\r\nI
      found this to be a difficult read, although others with a better background
      in chemistry and math, may find it more accessible than I."

    - 'Disrupt: Think the Unthinkable'
    - "In Disrupt, Luke Williams describes a process that he calls \"Disruptive Thinking.\"
      \ Williams states that it is a cookbook approach to innovation.  In developing
      the process, Williams seems to have taken many of the disruptive innovation
      concepts introduced by Clayton Christensen in his 1997 book entitled, \"The
      Innovator's Dilemma\" and combined them with the Design Thinking process developed
      by Tim Brown at IDEO.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Disruptive Thinking and Design Thinking
      processes are strikingly similar with their emphasis on empathy, an anthropological
      approach to research, rapid prototyping and a belief that innovation grows out
      of failure not success.  The process has five stages:\r\n1. Craft a disruptive
      hypothesis\r\n2. Define a disruptive market opportunity\r\n3. Generate several
      disruptive ideas\r\n4. Shape them into a single, disruptive solution\r\n5. Make
      a disruptive pitch to convince internal and external stakeholders to invest
      in or adopt what you've created. NOTE: The stages are quoted from the book.\r\n\r\nWhile
      the process itself and the underpinning philosophy were not particularly original,
      Williams did offer some good advice.  Prior to beginning the process, Williams
      recommended that the innovation team identify cliches within the market they
      wish to disrupt.  Then he explained that the team should invert the cliche and
      explore the feasibility of the new perspective.  He provided several examples
      including a soft drink company that decided that drinks should not be sweet
      and that they should be expensive.  This, of course, inverted the common wisdom
      of the soft drink industry.  The company was Red Bull and went on to produce
      a highly successful product.\r\n\r\nWilliams also provided guidelines for making
      a successful pitch.  His step-by-step instructions for the presentation were
      designed to capture maximum attention and to generate excitement about the product.\r\n\r\nA
      word of caution when considering what the author himself describes as a cookbook
      approach to innovation.  Bruce Nussbaum, former assistant editor for Business
      Week and now a professor of Innovation and Design, contends that the reason
      that Design Thinking has had a negligible impact on business, despite its popularity,
      is because CEOs have implemented it in cookbook fashion.  Here is a link to
      Nussbaum's analysis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fastcodesign.com/1663558/design-thinking-is-a-failed-experiment-so-whats-next"

    - Creativity
    - "Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is a psychology professor at the University of Chicago.
      \ He is best known for his identification of a phenomenon that he coined \"Flow.\"
      \ Flow is the state of complete concentration achieved by highly motivated individuals
      engaged in a task where time seems to stand still.  Flow has been associated
      with highly creative individuals.  It has also been observed in gamers.  Research
      suggests that the state of Flow actually reflects physiological changes in the
      brain.\r\n\r\n\"Creativity\" is Csikszentmihalyi's most recent book.  It reports
      on the results of 91 interviews with exceptional individuals that were conducted
      between 1990 and 1995.  The interviewees all had to have had a significant impact
      on the direction of their cultural domain.  The domains included the sciences,
      arts, government, business or human well-being.  Those interviewed generally
      had to be at least 60 years old and still active in a domain.  \r\n\r\nCreativity
      involves the interaction of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.  The Domain, or culture
      that contains symbolic rules,\r\n2.  An individual who introduces novelty into
      the symbolic domain, and \r\n3.  The field comprised of individuals with expertise
      capable of evaluating and validating innovation within the domain.\r\n\r\nCsikszentmihalyi
      observes that Creativity is a property of a system rather than an individual.
      \ While individuals may be personally creative or brilliant, Creativity with
      a \"Capital C\" requires the three elements described above.  \r\n\r\nBased
      on his interviews, the author found that creative people tended to have many
      paradoxical traits.  They tend to be humble and proud, introverted in some ways
      but also extroverted in others.  They tended to be passionate about their work,
      but also very objective about it.  Creative individuals tended to be very open
      to new ideas, but had an tremendous amount of perseverance.  The most common
      trait that they shared is a love of the creative process.\r\n\r\nThe author
      identifies five steps in the creative process.  These are:\r\n\r\n1. Preparation
      - becoming immersed in the problem.\r\n2. Incubation - subconscious analysis
      and/or manipulation of the problem or issue.\r\n3. Insight - the aha! moment\r\n4.
      Evaluation\r\n5. Elaboration - the work.\r\n\r\nCreativity, Csikszentmihalyi
      contends, is a recursive, rather than a linear process.\r\n\r\nThe individuals
      interviewed reported that school had little effect on their lives or success.
      \ In fact, some seemed to suggest that school threatened to destroy their creativity.
      \ On the other hand, most did mention individual teachers who had had a positive
      effect on their lives.  These teachers recognized the potential of the student
      and provided them with additional challenges.\r\n\r\nThe creative individuals
      did not appear to be shaped by their environments.  In fact they took very diverse
      paths.  Some had very happy childhoods while others had tragic ones.  Many had
      lost a father early in life.  All of the interviewees had an intense drive to
      succeed. \r\n\r\nWhile some research has suggested that creativity peaks in
      a person's thirties, this was not the case with the sample interviewed.  In
      fact, they reported higher levels of creative productivity much later in life.
      \ This was attributed to a greater foundation of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe book
      concludes with strategies that individuals, teachers and parents can use to
      stimulate creativity."

    - Creating Innovators
    - "Tony Wagner is the innovation education fellow at the Technology and Entrepreneurship
      Center at Harvard.  He also is the former co-director of the Change Leadership
      Group at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.  Wagner collaborated with
      Robert A. Compton, a video producer, who has produced numerous full length documentaries
      on global education.  Compton produced video interviews with several of the
      people reported upon in the book.  The videos were embedded in the eBook edition.
      \ They are also available at the web address above.\r\n\r\nCreating Innovators
      presents an interesting compliment to \"Creativity\" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
      \ Csikszentmihalyi studied the characteristics of people who had distinguished
      themselves in their respective fields for their creativity and innovation.  His
      subjects, for the most part, were over 60 years of age and had already accrued
      a portfolio of accomplishments.  Csikszentmihalyi, or one of his team of researchers,
      interviewed each of the subjects to determine how parents, educators, and mentors
      influenced the development of creativity in the individual.\r\n\r\nWagner's
      study was very similar to that of Csikszentmihalyi although his subjects were
      very different.  Wagner interviewed young entrepreneurs and innovators between
      the ages of 21 and 31.  While they had all demonstrated innovative and entrepreneurial
      skills, for the most part they had not yet achieved wide spread recognition
      for their accomplishments.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of Wagner's subjects had supportive
      parents who encouraged their children to take risks, explore their interests
      and solve their own problems.  They provided time for creative play and eschewed
      \"helicopter parents\" who hovered over their children and structured their
      every moment.\r\n\r\nThe subjects in Csikszentmihalyi's study reported a different
      relationship with their parents, although the effect may have been the same.
      \ Csikszentmihalyi noted that a significant number of the people in his study
      grew up in homes where the father had died while the subject was just a child.
      \ The author suggested that this might have given more latitude to the child
      to develop skills and assume responsibility early.\r\n\r\nOne consistent finding
      of both studies was the perception by the subjects that teachers and schools
      had played no productive role in their lives.  In both studies, however, the
      subjects described some adult that had served as a mentor and inspiration.\r\n\r\nBoth
      Csikszentmihalyi and Wagner concluded that creativity and innovation emerge
      through a process.  Wagner describes the process as evolving through three developmental
      stages: Play (early childhood), Passion (adolescence) and Purpose (adulthood).
      \ He contends that each stage is simply a refinement of the previous one.\r\n\r\nWagner
      also describes specific skills that the innovator develops as they pass through
      these stages: 1) Critical thinking and problem solving, 2) Collaboration, 3)
      Agility and adaptability, 4) Initiative and entrepreneurship, 5) Acessing and
      analyzing information, 6) Effective written and oral communication, and 7) Curiosity
      and imagination.\r\n\r\nWagner is very critical of education in America.  He
      notes that the one size fits all model of education stifles creativity and innovation.
      \ He provides examples of how subjects in his study were undervalued and sometimes
      punished for being different.  He, along with several business leaders from
      companies such as Apple and Google, observe that schools prize individual accomplishments
      and \"right\" answers, yet these are not what innovative companies seek or value.\r\n\r\nWagner
      is equally critical of even the most prestigious of American Universities.  His
      interviews reveal that the college professors who had the greatest impact on
      the innovators in the study were often on the fringes of the universities.  They
      tended to work with students in applied, rather than theoretical classes and
      they often were paid less because they were ineligible for tenure track positions.
      \ Wagner questions the focus on research over instruction in many of the nation's
      top universities and calls for educational leaders at every level to re-examine
      current educational practices."

    - How Will You Measure Your Life?
    - "Clayton Christensen co-authored this book with James Allworth, an Australian
      student attending the Harvard Business School and Karen Dillon, the former editor
      of the Harvard Business Review.\r\n\r\nChristensen, widely recognized as a leader
      in the innovative business practices, has published numerous books on disruptive
      innovation in the marketplace.  \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" grew out
      of a commencement speech that Christensen gave at Harvard in 2010.  Christensen
      delivered the address after suffering a heart attack and being diagnosed with
      the same cancer that had killed his father.  The commencement address was based
      upon a lesson that Christensen used to end his MBA courses at HBS.  Just as
      Christensen began to write \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" he experienced
      a stroke that effected his expressive language.  With the help of his family
      and co-authors, he persisted and the book was published in May 2012.\r\n\r\nIn
      \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\" Christensen goes beyond the world of business
      and demonstrates how the same systems that one uses to make good decisions in
      business can be applied when making the even more important decisions in life.
      \ The author describes how many of his fellow Harvard Business School graduates
      went on to highly successful lives.  Yet, many saw their personal lives crumble
      around them.  In some cases such as Jeffrey Skilling, CEO of Enron, they ended
      up in jail.  In fact the last chapter was entitled \"Staying Out of Jail.\"
      \ In this chapter, Christensen explained how his intense religious faith and
      adherence to his values allowed him to have a truly happy life both personally
      and in business.\r\n\r\nThe book opens with Christensen recapping his theory
      on how innovative businesses disrupt a market by focusing on products at the
      bottom of the market while they improve and grow.  They are not seen as a threat
      at first, because market leaders see them as only addressing a niche need. Market
      leaders also are reluctant to compete with them, because the market they service
      offers low margins which are no longer acceptable to their investors.  Christensen
      offers the example of the steel industry where Nucor disrupted the industry
      by introducing mini-mills.  They began by focusing on rebar, the lowest end
      of the steel market, while the large, integrated steel mills were concentrating
      on more lucrative sheet steel.  Eventually, Nucor and the mini-mills became
      more sophisticated and were able to move up market.  By that time, the large
      steel mills were unable to compete and they were replaced.\r\n\r\nChristensen
      then told the story of how he was invited to speak to secretary of defense William
      Cohen and his staff.  Christensen expected the meeting to be with the secretary
      and a few interns.  When he arrived he was greeted by the secretary, the Joint
      Chiefs of Staff and the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  When Christensen
      finished his description of the disruption of the steel industry, the chairman
      of the Joint Chiefs asked Christensen if he knew why they were interested in
      his theory.  The chairman pointed to the top of Christensen's chart where the
      large steel mills were depicted.  The chairman explained that the large steel
      mills were the former Soviets, who were no longer the enemy.  The bottom of
      the chart were the terrorists.  The U.S. Armed Forces had focused all of their
      efforts on the high end, just as most market leaders do.  The Joint Chiefs recognized
      that they needed a completely new organization to deal with this new type of
      warfare and the Joint Forces Command was born.\r\n\r\nChristensen discussed
      the role that motivation plays in not only our work life, but also our personal
      life.  Many businesses, he pointed out, view incentives as motivators.  Incentives,
      however, are not the same as motivation.  Christensen referenced the work of
      Frederick Hertzberg who developed the \"Two-factor Theory\" of motivation consisting
      of \"Hygiene Factors\" and \"Motivators.\"  Hygiene Factors are things, such
      as compensation, supervisory practices and company policies that can cause dissatisfaction.
      \ They do not, however, motivate.  Motivators are intrinsic factors that relate
      to the work itself.  Christensen points out that it is possible to love your
      job and hate it at the same time.  You can be motivated and dissatisfied simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOne
      of the greatest weaknesses that many businesses face is that they concentrate
      on the products that they want to sell to the customer rather than on focusing
      on what the customer actually wants and needs.  Here, Christiansen discusses
      the need for \"Empathy\" and describes a process very similar to that used by
      IDEO to determine customer needs.  He noted that in many cases companies guess
      at what customers want and change their products accordingly.  In most of these
      cases the changes result in little or no increase in sales.\r\n\r\nRather than
      focus on the product, Christensen recommends trying to determine what \"job\"
      the customer is is actually \"hiring\" the product to accomplish.  At this point,
      the author turns his attention on schools.  To many, schools are a job that
      students must get done.  From the student's perspective, however, school is
      not the job, but rather the tool to get the job done.  Students want schools
      to make them feel successful and to help them make friends.  Christensen contends
      that most schools fail miserably at these tasks, often making children feel
      like failures.  Worse yet, he points out that, like businesses, school reform
      attempts generally focus on dimensions that are totally irrelevant to what students
      need.\r\n\r\nFinally, Christensen asks, \"Why is it that the big, established
      companies that have so much capital find these initiatives (disruptive innovations)
      to be so costly?  Any why do the small entrants with much less capital find
      them to be straightforward?\"  Christensen contends that this is due to the
      well accepted business theory of marginal vs. full costs.  As companies look
      at doing something completely new, they see the full costs, which increase costs
      and lower margins.  If they attempt to simply leverage what they already have,
      they do not include the full cost, but only the new cost.  Thus, this incremental
      change almost always wins out even though the resources that they are leveraging
      are generally ill-equipped or even unwilling to make the necessary changes that
      true innovation requires.  \r\n\r\nChristensen warns, \"Thinking on a marginal
      basis can be very very dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, Christensen
      gives examples of how \"priorities, balancing plans with opportunities, and
      allocating your resources\" provides a successful strategy whether in business
      or family life.  His final chapter deals with integrity and understanding the
      person you want to be."

    - 11 Rules for Creating Value in the Social Era
    - "Nilofer Merchant has served as a CEO and then a board member of a NASDAQ-traded
      company.  She has also consulted with numerous Fortune 500 companies including
      HP, Nokia, Adobe, Symantec and Yahoo!  She is a frequent contributor to the
      Harvard Business Review and has written a previous book entitled, The New How:
      Creating Business Solutions Through Collaborative Strategy.  She lectures on
      innovation and marketing at Stanford University.\r\n\r\n11 Rules begins with
      an obituary for \"Traditional Strategy.\"  This clever personification of the
      business model taught in business schools throughout the nation prizes marketing
      data, stability, control and scale.  The Traditional Strategy decides what it
      wants to produce and then sets about convincing the consumer that they want
      or need it.\r\n\r\nMerchant contends that we have moved into a new \"Social
      Era\" where consumers expect to be co-creators of products. They require businesses
      to be agile and responsive to their wants and needs.  Businesses run using the
      Traditional Strategy are ill-equipped to meet these new demands.\r\n\r\nMerchant
      states that \"the Social Era is about connecting things, people and ideas.\"
      Hierarchical controls, large inventories and huge payrolls, typical of successful
      companies using the Traditional Strategy, serve as barriers to success in this
      new era.\r\n\r\nAs in much of the literature on motivation and innovation today,
      Merchant stresses the need to establish shared purpose among workers.   She
      states that purpose is a much more powerful motivator than money.  When shared
      purpose is coupled with shared power, people will self-organize to reach a goal.\r\n\r\nThe
      Rules\r\n\r\n1. Connections create value.\r\n2. Power in community.\r\n3. Collaboration
      > controle.\r\n4. Celebrate Onlyness.\r\n5. Allow all talent.\r\n6. Consumers
      become co-creators.\r\n7. Mistakes can build trust.\r\n8. Learn. Unlearn. (Repeat).\r\n9.
      Bank on openess.\r\n10. Social purpose unleashes ownership.\r\n11. There are
      no answers."

    - 'Higgs Discovery: The Power of Empty Space'
    - "Lisa Randall is the Frank J. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University.
      \ Randall studies theoretical physics and cosmology and is considered one of
      the most cited and highly influential theoretical physicists in the field today.\r\n\r\nHiggs
      Discovery is a short eBook that Randall wrote immediately following the discovery
      of the Higgs Boson on July 4, 2012.  The first part of the book describes the
      study being conducted by Cern at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which spans
      the border between France and Switzerland.  Randall has written two previous
      books about the search for the Higgs Boson at the LHC.  The Higgs Discovery
      includes a chapter from each of those books that focused on the significance
      of the Higgs and why it was important to verify what was, up until July 4, 2012,
      and accepted, but theoretical construct.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Randall's writing,
      the discovery had not been confirmed as the actual Higgs particle.   This did
      not happen until September 12, 2012.  None-the-less, the experiment had definitely
      discovered a new particle and and the news caused a great deal of excitement
      not just in the scientific community, but also among the general public.\r\n\r\nThe
      Higgs Boson confirmed the existence of the Higgs Mechanism, which has long been
      thought as the way that subatomic particles acquire mass.  The discovery of
      the Higgs Boson provided evidence for the first time that such a process did
      indeed exist.  While not the sole focus of the experiments being conducted at
      the LHC, finding the elusive Higgs was definitely the Marque investigation."

    - Leading Change
    - "Leading Change was first published in 1996 and quickly became a best seller.
      \ The 2012 edition included a new preface where the author highlighted how the
      need for agile and change-oriented organizations are even more essential today.
      \ Kotter noted that the ability to lead change was needed at every level within
      an organization, not just at top management.\r\n\r\nKotter began by identifying
      eight mistakes that change leaders often make.  These mistakes can lead to disappointing
      results, if not absolute failure.  The mistakes include:\r\n\r\n1.  Allowing
      too much complacency. (A sense of urgency must be established.)\r\n2.  Failure
      to establish a sufficiently powerful guiding coalition.\r\n3.  Underestimating
      the power of vision.\r\n4.  Under communicating the vision.\r\n5.  Permitting
      obstacles to block the new vision.\r\n6.  Failing to create short-term wins.\r\n7.
      \ Declaring victory too soon.\r\n8.  Neglecting to anchor change firmly in the
      corporate culture.\r\n\r\nSome of the consequences of these mistakes can lead
      to:\r\n\r\n1.  New strategies not being implemented well.\r\n2.  Acquisitions
      don't achieve expected synergies.\r\n3.  Re-engineering takes too long and costs
      too much.\r\n4.  Downsizing doesn't get costs under control.\r\n5.  Quality
      programs don't deliver hoped for results.\r\n\r\nKotter distinguished Management
      and Leadership.  \r\n\r\nManagement: \"a set of processes that can keep a complicated
      system of people and technology running smoothly.\"\r\nLeadership: \"a set of
      processes that creates organization in the first place or adapts them to significantly
      changing circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nQuote: \"Inwardly focused employees can have
      difficulty seeing the very forces that present threats and opportunities.\"\r\n\r\nThe
      Eight Step Process\r\n\r\n1.  Establishing a sense of urgency.  Fight complacency
      while avoiding panic.\r\n2.  Creating the guiding coalition.  Must have members
      with real power.\r\n3.  Developing a vision and strategy. Needs to be simple
      and jargon-free.\r\n4.  Communicating the change vision.  Over and over again.\r\n5.
      \ Empowering employees for broad-based action.  Simply stating that they are
      empowered is not sufficient.  They must be prepared.\r\n6.  Generating short-term
      wins. (visible, unambiguous and clearly related to the change effort.  Note:
      People do not plan adequately for these wins because they are overwhelmed.)\r\n7.
      \ Consolidating gains and producing more change.\r\n8.  Anchoring new approaches
      in the culture. This comes at the end of a transformation, not at the beginning."

    - The Particle at the End of the Universe
    - "Sean Carroll is theoretical physicist at the Cal Tech.  He has written several
      books both for popular audiences and scientists.  The Particle at the End of
      the Universe refers to the Higgs Boson that researchers believe they discovered
      at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.  In his latest book
      Carroll describes not only how the discovery was made but why it is important.\r\n\r\nCarroll
      shares that he played no role in the experiments at the LHC, but that he based
      the book on his knowledge of the project and interviews with the project leaders.
      \ The Particle at the End of the Universe was written for a general audience
      of people with an interest, but not necessarily a level of expertise in physics
      or science in general.\r\n\r\nIn addition to explaining the significance of
      the Higgs Boson, Carroll provides an understandable explanation of elementary
      particles and how they interact.  He explains complex concepts such as fields,
      symmetry and spontaneous symmetry-breaking in terms that are understandable
      to the lay person.  \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1.  \"I found studies showing kids
      love science up until the ages of ten to fourteen years old.\r\n2.  Fermions
      are particles that make up matter.\r\n3.  Bosons carry forces.  \r\n4.  Leptons
      are elementary particles that have a charge such as Taus, Muons and Electrons
      (in descending order of weight)\r\n5.  The Higgs field permeates empty space.
      \ The more strongly a particle couples with the Higgs field the more mass it
      acquires.\r\n6.  The LHC project has people from 70 countries working together
      side by side.  Palestinians working with Israelis and Iraqi scientists working
      with Iranians (Joe Incandela)\r\n7.  Although the U.S. is not an official partner
      in the LHC project, a major step forward occurred when the U.S. agreed to contribute
      $2 billion to the project in 1997.  This led to more that 1,000 American scientists
      working on the project.\r\n8.  The overwhelming amount of data collected at
      the LHC is immediately discarded.\r\n9.  Pauli Exclusion Principle - No two
      fermion particles can occupy the same space. This is what makes physical constructs
      possible.\r\n10. Bosons can stack on top of each other.\r\n11. Mass is not related
      to gravity at all.\r\n12. Most forces such as the strong, gravitation or electromagnetic,
      act the same no matter if you observe them directly or through a mirror.  The
      weak force, however, treats right and left differently.\r\n13. Every paper that
      comes out of the CMS or ATLAS experiments at the LHC has over 3,000 authors
      listed alphabetically.\r\n15. The LHC has cost about $9 Billion.\r\n16.  Fermions
      that feel the strong force are quarks and those that don't are leptons.\r\n17.
      \ Unlike quarks, leptons can move freely throughout space.  Note:  Quarks are
      found in the nucleus in protons and neutrons, thus they are contained within
      Hadrons.\r\n18.  Symmetry breaking is an environmental phenomenon.  If you perform
      an experiment on a train moving at 60 miles an hour, it performs the same as
      when it was standing still if you have no windows.  If you stick your hand out
      the window, however, the environment changes through your awareness.  The Higgs
      field acts the same.  It is hidden in the background, but it changes particles
      with which it interacts by slowing them down and thus adding mass."

    - 'True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership'
    - "Bill George is a professor of management practice at the Harvard Business School.
      \ Previously, he was the CEO of Medtronics, the leading medical technology company
      in the world.\r\n\r\nTrue North deals with Authentic Leadership.  According
      to the author, the Authentic Leader integrates Purpose, Values, Relationships,
      Self-Discipline and Heart.  George uses the metaphor of a compass pointing to
      True North with \"Self-Awareness\" at its center and its anchor points being
      \"Motivation,\" \"Support Team,\" \"Integrated Life,\" and \"Values and Principles.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge
      sees a tremendous vacuum in leadership today in all facets of society, which
      he believes is due to the notion that leadership only occurs at the top of an
      organization.  George contends that true leadership can and should occur at
      all levels and that there are many very capable leaders at every level of an
      organization.  In fact, the key to a successful organization, the author states
      is to have leaders at every level, even those with no direct supervisory responsibility.\r\n\r\nGeorge
      describes the \"Journey to Authentic Leadership\" as having three distinct phases.
      \ The first thirty years he calls \"Preparing for Leadership.\"  This is comprised
      for education, studying, extracurricular activities and early work experiences.
      \ The second thirty years (30-60) is the \"Leading\" phase.  The final phase
      is \"Giving Back\" when leaders share their knowledge and wisdom with others
      in many different organizations, while continuing to actively pursue their own
      learning.\r\n\r\nThe author describes five types of leaders who lose sight of
      their True North.  They are:\r\n\r\n1. Glory Seekers - motivated by the acclaim
      of others.\r\n2. Imposters - who lack self-awareness and self-esteem.\r\n3.
      Rationalizers - who deviate from their values and attempt to justify doing so.\r\n4.
      Loners - who fail to build personal support structures\r\n5. Shooting Stars
      - who lack the grounding of an integrated life.\r\n\r\nQuote: \"The role of
      leaders is not to get others to follow them but to empower others to lead.\"\r\nQuote:
      \"Leadership principles are values translated into action.\"\r\nQuote: \"No
      one achieves anything brilliant by mitigating their weaknesses.\" - Alice Woodwark
      (Consultant at McKinsey).\r\n\r\nGeorge also describes six Leadership Styles:\r\n\r\n1.
      Directive Leaders - demand compliance and obedience with rules.\r\n2. Engaged
      Leaders - mobilize people around shared purpose and values.\r\n3. Coaching Leaders
      - develop people for leadership roles.\r\n4. Consensus Leders - Build agreement
      through participation.\r\n5. Affiliative Leaders - Create emotional bonds and
      harmony.\r\n6. Expert Leaders - Expect competence and self-direction."

    - 'Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think'
    - "Viktor Mayer-Schonberger is Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation
      at the Oxford Internet Institute, Oxford University.  Kenneth Cukier is the
      co-author, and is the Data Editor of the Economist.\r\n\r\nBig Data is a term
      coined by scientists working in the areas of astronomy and genomics.  It refers
      to the collection and analysis of large quantities of data that may be combined
      in different ways for different purposes.  One of the primary differentiating
      characteristic of Big Data Analysis is that it is not used to determine causality,
      but only correlations.  However, because Big Data uses a data pool that approaches
      the full corpus rather than a representative sample, it has great value for
      decision-making.\r\n\r\nThe authors note that statistical practices that require
      pristine data and stringent controls were developed because of the scarcity
      of data in the past.  These procedures were created to allow the investigators
      to draw conclusions based on small samples of data and then to extrapolate them
      to the total data set, or corpus.  Since Big Data uses almost the entire corpus
      in its analysis, it does not require the data to be cleansed and controlled.
      \ This saves both time and money.\r\n\r\nThe authors note that it is estimated
      that in 2013 approximately 1,200 exabytes (one billion gigabytes) of stored
      information existed.  Of that data, only 2 percent was non-digital.\r\n\r\nThe
      use of Big Data represents a shift in the way that we analyze information:\r\n\r\n1.
      We can analyze far more data, sometimes the entire data set for a particular
      phenomenon.\r\n2. More data permits us to require less exactitude,\r\n3. The
      first two changes allow us to move away from a need for causality, since correlations
      are so powerful with large data sets.\r\n\r\nPredictions based on the correlations
      are the primary value of Big Data analysis.  Big Data answers the question \"What\"
      not \"Why.\"  The authors provide examples of how Big Data has been used to
      improve the identification of potential problems.\r\n\r\nGoogle was able to
      track the spread of the H1N1 flu virus more accurately and quickly based on
      search terms being used in areas affected than the Department of Health because
      it was using real time data and algorithms that correlated search terms to flu
      out breaks.  In New York City, a team of young data analysts were able to increase
      the accuracy of identifying \"firetraps\" by combining data from complaint calls,
      geographical records, fire calls, energy usage patterns and request for building
      permits.  By correlating all of this disparate data, they were able to direct
      inspectors to the most serious violators and significantly reduced fire calls
      to these areas.\r\n\r\nBig Data also has been used by businesses to fine tune
      marketing strategies.  Walmart found that the sale of strawberry pop tarts skyrocketed
      when a hurricane was predicted.  This led to them moving Pop Tarts to the front
      of the store in areas where a hurricane was predicted, which led to higher sales
      and greater convenience for shoppers.  Target has used customer data to predict
      customer needs and to customize advertising.  For instance, they found a high
      correlation between the purchase of certain products and customers who were
      expecting babies.  The store then sent advertisements and coupons to those customers
      focused on child care needs.  In one instance they sent these to a teen age
      girl whose father became irate and filed a complaint.  When the store manager
      followed-up a while later, the father apologized and stated that he later found
      out that his daughter was expecting.\r\n\r\nThe Target story alludes to one
      of the biggest concerns about the use of Big Data, a loss of privacy.  The authors
      contend that current privacy strategies are insufficient in the age of Big Data.
      \ These consist of:\r\n\r\n1. Individual notice and consent\r\n2. Opting out\r\n3.
      Anonymization\r\n\r\nIn several studies using big data, it was demonstrated
      that identifying individuals from anonymous data was relatively easy and quick.
      \ Another threat posed by Big Data is the predictive capability.  The authors
      fear that correlations derived from Big Data might be used against individuals
      who have characteristics that might predict criminal behavior.  Thus, law enforcement
      could attempt to preemptively stop crime by punishing or individuals before
      they act.  \r\n\r\nThe authors suggest three strategies for avoiding these abuses.
      \ They are:\r\n\r\n1. Shift privacy protection from individual consent to the
      data-users accountability\r\n2. Enshrine human agency amid predictions\r\n3.
      Create a new profession of Big Data auditors, which the authors call algorithmists."

    - Flight of the Buffalo
    - "Flight of the Buffalo was co-authored by James Belasco and Ralph C. Strayer.
      \ Belasco is a professor of management at San Diego State University.  He is
      a best selling author and consultant to major international corporations.\r\n\r\nRalph
      Strayer is the former CEO of Johnsonville Foods.  His innovative leadership
      in his former position made him the \"hero\" in Tom Peters' management video,
      \"The Leadership Alliance.\"\r\n\r\nFlight of the Buffalo uses the analogy of
      the Head Buffalo that relentlessly and individually leads the herd.  When the
      Head Buffalo stops, the whole herd stops, which the authors point out is why
      it was so easy to slaughter Buffalo.  Geese, however, continuously rotate the
      lead.  This allows them to fly for longer periods and add protection as they
      all feel responsible for the flock.\r\n\r\nFlight of the Buffalo describes the
      journey of the authors from an \"authoritarian\" Head Buffalo model of leadership
      to a \"share\" Geese-like leadership model.  The authors describe the struggles
      that they and their employees faced during the transition.  They also describe
      the benefits that made the struggle worth it.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for the
      transformation, according to the authors was, \"Understanding that I am the
      problem allowed me to learn how to become the solution.\" \r\n\r\nThe authors
      identified four Fundamental Leadership Principles:\r\n\r\n1. Transfer ownership.\r\n2.
      Create an environment for ownership where each person wants to be responsible.\r\n3.
      Coach the development of personal capabilities.\r\n4. Learn faster and encourage
      other to do the same.\r\n\r\nThe authors describe their first pitfall. \"I reacted
      instinctively to my newfound learning and ordered my people to be different.
      \ I told my senior staff, 'you are responsible to make your own decisions. From
      authoritarianism, I went to abdication.\"\r\n\r\nThe struggle faced by managers
      was highlighted by the story of a vice-president.  The authors state,\r\n\r\n\"He
      sincerely tried to make the same decisions I would have made. He knew that I
      liked my decisions better than his, so he spent a lot of time trying to decide
      what I would do in a situation.  I had trained him one way and now expected
      him to behave another way.  He couldn't do it. Even though I worked with him
      extensively for over a year and a half, and hired personal consultants to work
      with him, I eventually had to replace him.  I was devastated, for I had failed
      my friend.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Leader, \"As long as he sees his role as
      solving problems, people will bring him problems to solve.\"\r\n\r\nThe Leader,
      at every level in the organization, must strive to implement four principles:\r\n\r\n1.
      Transfer ownership for work to those who execute the work.\r\n2. Create the
      environment for ownership where each person wants to be responsible for his/her
      own performance.\r\n    a. Paint a clear picture of great performance for the
      organization and each person.\r\n    b. Focus individuals on the few factors
      that create great performance.\r\n    c. Develop the desire for each person
      to own-be responsible for-his/her own great performance.\r\n    e. Align organization
      systems and structures that send a clear message as to what is necessary for
      great performance for the individual and the organization.\r\n    f. Energize
      individuals around the focus of the business.\r\n3. Coach the development of
      individual capability and competence.\r\n4. Learn faster.\r\n    a. Learn themselves
      (Leaders)\r\n    b. Create the conditions under which every person in the organization
      is challenged to continually learn faster.\r\n\r\nQuote:  \"Eighteen months
      later, I was still getting long lists to fix at every meeting.  I ran out of
      patience before they ran out of things for me to fix.\"  \"I was owning all
      the responsibility for fixing the problems.  The employees' job was to identify
      what needed to be fixed, and they were truly dedicated to doing that job well.
      \ They worked hard to keep me working hard.\"  \"And the plant continued to
      flounder.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:  \" I realized that I had trained them to be dependent
      on me...When I wanted them to be flexible like a gaggle of geese, they had no
      model or training in how to fly.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:  \"Great Coaches did more than
      than ask questions and not give answers.  Great coaches had to provide guidance
      so people could find the \"right\" answer.\r\n\r\nQuote:  \"I learned that incorrect
      attitudes are symptoms of incorrect systems, structures and practices.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:
      \ \"We all share a deep desire for feedback on our performance.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:
      \ \"I found that the more I solved people's problems, the more problems they'd
      bring to me.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:  \"The responsibility for performance is always
      owned by the performer.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:  \" I know that dramatic change in the
      largest organizations can/must take less than a year if it is to be effective.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:
      \ \"Knowledge is nothing without action.  Nothing changes until you do something.\"\r\n\r\nQuote:
      \ \"He who makes no mistakes ends up making nothing.\""

    - 'Learning with Big Data: The Future of Education'
    - "This is a companion novel to Big Data, also authored by Viktor Mayer-Schonberger
      and Kenneth Cukier.  Learning with Big Data is a short (60 pages) treatise that
      discusses the benefits and potential risks associated with the use of Big Data
      in education.\r\n\r\nThe authors note that education collects a massive amount
      of data surrounding student learning, but uses very little of it.  At most,
      data is used to take periodic snapshots of student performance, which has little
      value instructionally.  Worse yet, it can lead to assumptions that are incorrect
      in predicting the student's potential mastery of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nOne
      of the most exciting and promising uses of Big Data is adaptive-learning.  With
      the pervasive use of digital learning platforms, it is now possible to identify
      learning profiles and preferences for individual students and adjust instructional
      strategies to maximize learning.  While this has obvious benefits, the authors
      admit that \"adaptive-learning algorithms are a spooky art.\"  The authors provide
      numerous examples of how data analytics have improved student learning, most
      notably the results achieved by the Khan Academy.  The also cite a math remediation
      program initiated by Arizona State University using the Knewton Adaptive Learning
      Platform.  ASU was able to increase pass rates by 11 percentage points and cut
      drop out rates by half.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mayer-Schonberger, Big Data has
      the potential to transform education in three ways:\r\n\r\n1.  It enables us
      to accrue feedback data on a scale never before possible,\r\n2.  It allows the
      customization of learning down to the individual, rather than just to groups
      of similar students,\r\n3.  It allows us to make predictions that allow for
      optimization of what, when and how students learn.\r\n\r\nThe authors also observe
      that the data on how students learn is available through most of the digital
      tools that they use.  This, they suggest, should shatter the monopoly schools
      currently have on education and learning.\r\n\r\nThe authors also identify many
      potential problems posed by the use of Big Data.  The greatest of these is the
      loss of privacy.  They note that current privacy laws and practices are insufficient
      to protect students from unwarranted use of their data.  Another concern raised
      by the authors is the fact that customization of the learning process could
      limit shared learning experiences.\r\n\r\nUnlike a traditional statistical approach
      to data analysis that depend on small samples of data, Big Data works with large
      corpuses of data.  Big Data Analytics does not seek to identify cause and effect
      relationships, but only correlations.  The authors state that Big Data allows
      us for the first time to answer  \"how\" individual students learn."

    - 'The New Digital Age: Transforming Nations, Businesses, and Our Lives'
    - "This book was co-authored by Jared Cohen.  Eric Schmidt is the former CEO of
      Google.  Jared Cohen is the co-founder of Google Ideas.  He is the author of
      two books and has served as a member of the secretary of state's Policy Planning
      Staff.\r\n\r\nIn the The New Digital Age, Schmidt and Cohen describe the impact
      that mobile technologies, the Internet and social media have had, and will continue
      to have, on cultures around the world.  The authors call on their vast experiences
      working with world leaders from nations as diverse as North Korea, Finland and
      the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of the first observations that the authors make
      is that a \"Canyon\" exists between those who understand technology and those
      geopolitical leaders tasked with solving the wicked problems facing the world.
      \ This has led to them underutilizing these resources to reduce poverty, illness
      and climate change.  At the same time, laws and regulations have not kept up
      with the needs of the digital age.\r\n\r\nThe authors highlight the way that
      technology has empowered the common citizen citing the Arab Spring as a vivid
      example.  This sense of empowerment has not only been felt in technology rich
      nations, but even in closed nations such as North Korea where mobile phones
      are exorbitantly expensive, monitored and restricted.  Yet, the the demand for
      mobile phones has sky rocketed.  The authors note, however, that while the technology
      has empowered citizens to organize and revolt against oppression quickly, this
      has resulted in a compressed timeline that has not allowed the revolutionaries
      to train leaders and prepare for governance.  This was seen in the chaos that
      followed the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.\r\n\r\nSchmidt and Cohen also describe
      how the use of social media has allowed people with similar beliefs or backgrounds
      to find each other throughout the world.  The authors suggest that this could
      ultimately lead to \"Virtual Nations States.\"  Thus, if a group of citizens
      within a nation decided to secede, they could actually do so virtually, creating
      their own governance structure and economy.  How such a scenario would work
      while living within a physical nation remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nNations with
      common beliefs or interests could also form virtual alliances.  These could
      prove formidable if the pool resources and opt to impose their will on other
      less friendly nations through cyber attacks or espionage. \r\n\r\nSchmidt and
      Cohen also paint a rather dark picture of how technology could be used by governments
      to spy on citizens and propagandize at a level never achieved previously.  They
      point out that nations such as China and Russia are already using technology
      to disrupt business,intimidate leaders and conduct espionage.  In this sense,
      technology is an equalizer, since even a small nation with a dedicated effort
      could use technology to infiltrate far larger and mightier countries.\r\n\r\nThe
      authors believe that technology will transform education allowing students to
      concentrate on higher-order thinking skills and problem-solving.  Since information
      is, and will increasingly be, ubiquitously available through mobile technologies,
      rote learning will no longer be needed.\r\n\r\nOne very serious threat that
      the authors identify is the permanence of digital records.  They fear that young
      children may be haunted throughout their lives by things they add to their digital
      profiles today.  The authors suggest actions that governments might take to
      prevent this, but they note that this is a topic that parents should discuss
      with their children long before they discuss the birds and the bees."

    - 'Big Data @ Work: Dispelling the Myths, Uncovering the Opportunities'
    - "Big Data @ Work describes the ways that Big Data is changing almost every field.
      \ One of the challenges posed by Big Data is the need for a different type of
      analysis.  This has led to the emergence of a new professional class know as
      \"Data Scientists.\"  Data Scientists are different than traditional data analysts
      or statisticians.  The Data Scientist must have the analytical skills of the
      data analyst, but she must also have coding skills and a good understanding
      of business and products.  As a new and interdisciplinary field, Data Science
      is meritocratic.  There is no particular degree required.  The author note that
      Big Data \"resembles not so much a pool as an ongoing, fast-flowing stream.\r\n\r\nDavenport
      identifies three classes of value that Big Data offers:  1. cost reductions,
      2. decision improvements, and 3. improvements in products and services.  However,
      the impact of Big Data on organizational structures, customer relations and
      management practices is still unknown.  One thing that is known, however, is
      that the \"Real Time\" nature of Big Data allows companies to lead, rather than
      simply to react.  As an educator, I could not help but think of how Education
      still relies on snapshots often taken out of context and in the past and how
      the skillful use of Big Data could improve instruction and learning.\r\n\r\nDavenport
      shares an insight from UPS, which has been using Big Data for route optimization
      for some time.  UPS found that the data analytics process was relatively easy
      compared to introducing new approaches to its thousands of drivers.  The effectively
      use Big Data, requires organizations to use a more continuous and uncertain
      approach to decision making.  UPS track 16.3 million packages per day and stores
      over 16 petabytes of data.\r\n\r\nMachine Learning has proven to be an effective
      means of managing the high-velocity, high-volume nature of Big Data.  However,
      Davenport notes that this often yields results that are difficult to interpret
      and explain.\r\n\r\nDavenport discusses Hadoop, an open source Data File Management
      System used widely by companies engaged in the use of Big Data.  The author
      reports that many IT managers view Hadoop as a low-cost means of archiving and
      retrieving historical data.\r\n\r\nDavenport divides the history of Data Analytics
      into three eras.  \r\n\r\nAnalytics 1.0 (1954-2005) began with UPS introducing
      the first corporate analytics group.  This time period was characterized by
      small amounts of structured data.  Data analytics were considered marginal to
      the business function.\r\n\r\nAnalytics 2.0 (2000 -  ) began with the exploitation
      of online data by companies such as Yahoo, Google and eBay.\r\n\r\nAnalytics
      3.0 (2014 - ) evidence that some large companies are introducing a new way of
      analyzing and using data that combines Big Data and traditional analytics.  This
      can yield insights and products at high speed."

    - 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln'
    - Team of Rivals is a vivid and powerful treatise on Leadership in a times of
      extreme stress.  Kearns-Goodwin captures the essence of Lincoln's ability to
      keep focused on the goal no matter how many defeats he faced.  This not only
      required perseverance, but also a strong sense of humility.  He always put the
      cause above his own personal needs and pride.  Probably the best example of
      this was his continued support of Salmon Chase.  Even though Chase worked behind
      Lincoln's back politically and opposed him in his re-election, Lincoln continued
      to keep him in his cabinet and support him, because he could see the value that
      brought to the Union.  The book chronicles numerous similar stories.  In most
      cases, the Lincoln's opponents and rivals eventually came to respect him greatly.   Most
      notably was William Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State.  Seward, who many
      felt should have been elected president over Lincoln, came to view Lincoln as
      the most brilliant leader in history.  He was devoted to Lincoln throughout
      his time in the Lincoln cabinet.

    - 'Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One''s Looking'
    - "Christian Rudder was one of the founders of OKCupid a successful online dating
      website.  Through this experience, Rudder discovered that the data the site
      collected revealed patterns in human preferences and behavior that revealed
      much more about them than simply their dating preferences.  Rudder expanded
      his analysis of online data collected through other social media and information
      search engines.  Through this analysis, Rudder discovered subliminal trends
      in social values and behaviors that were inconsistent with the expressed values
      and behaviors of those involved.\r\n\r\nRudder explored concepts such as prejudice,
      beauty, and political beliefs.  He found that the information that people provide
      through online searches, and social media sites when taken in aggregate reveal
      things about their values and beliefs that may not be apparent, even to them,
      on a conscious level.  One interesting analysis revealed a relatively consistent
      definition of beauty when applied to women by men.  With some variability, this
      definition was consistent across races and nationalities.  Rudder was also able
      to demonstrate the impact of perceived beauty on women in the workplace.  His
      research revealed that when women applied for a job, their physical attractiveness
      was evaluated very similarly to how it was evaluated on the OkCupid site by
      prospective suitors.  This was even true when the person doing the hiring was
      a woman.  Another trend that became apparent was that a person's perception
      of beauty changed through interactions.  People rated the beauty of a person
      that they knew higher than if they simply were viewing an image of the person.\r\n\r\nZipg's
      Law:  In any large body of text, a word's popularity (in place in the lexicon
      with 1 being the highest) multiplied by the number of times it appears is the
      same for every word in the text.  rank x number = constant.\r\n\r\nLaw of Large
      Numbers: The full truth of data is only revealed over a large sample.  If the
      data set is robust enough, it will provide answers without the questions being
      asked.\r\n\r\nParson's Code:  The algorithm used by sites such as Shazam to

    - 'Digital Destiny: How the new age of data will transform the way we work, live,
      and communicate'
    - "Shawn DuBravac is the chief economist and senior director of research for the
      Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).  DuBravak discusses the impact that
      the ubiquitous availability of digital data will have on every aspect of our
      lives.  DuBravac suggests that the theory of market disruption that has dominated
      economics since Christensen published his seminal work on innovation in 1997
      is going to be replaced by the marketplace of Multisided Platforms.\r\n\r\nDuBravac
      contends that Data in all of its manifestation will be the lifeblood of the
      future world.   He notes that the Internet simply \"expanded on the revolution
      Gutenberg had begun five hundred years earlier.\"\r\n\r\nThe author provides
      a detailed list of properties of data:\r\n1.  Permanent - There has always been
      a strong human desire to capture data\r\n2. Replicable - Data replicates because
      it has value\r\n3. Instantaneous - Data needs recognized, recorded and understood
      instantly to capture its full value.  JPB: this is the primary failure in education's
      use of data\r\n4. Efficient - Data wants to be understood, which has pushed
      mankind to constantly seek better ways to collect, store and analyze data.\r\n5.
      Moving - data seeks to move or be transmitted and shared\r\n6. Infinitely divisible-
      data can be bundled, unbundled, sliced and diced.\r\n\r\nData explosions have
      only occurred twice throughout history and they have resulted in chaos and creativity.
      \ The two explosions that DuBravac cites are the printing press and the digitization
      of data.\r\n\r\nDigital data has led to sensors that passively collect steady
      streams of data from sources throughout the environment.  Digital data and the
      devices that collect and store it such as smart phones, wearables etc. have
      removed the line between the virtual world and the physical world.\r\n\r\nThe
      International Data Corporation predicts that by 2020 the number of connected
      \"things\" will grow by 50% to 30 billion.  They also predict that networked
      sensors will grow to a trillion.\r\n\r\nWe tend to waste that which becomes
      abundant.  This leads to a constant struggle to create value where digital markets
      create abundance.\r\nMGI and McKinsey's Business Technology Office indicate
      that there is a critical shortage of individuals with analytical expertise in
      the US.  There is an even larger need for managers with the expertise necessary
      to understand and make decisions  based on the analysis of data.\r\n\r\nOne
      of the areas where digital data is and will continue to have the greatest impact
      is in healthcare and the healthcare industry.  DuBravac predicts that the need
      for office visits will be greatly reduced as sensors and monitors track and
      communicate patient data over the Internet.  This should lower health costs
      dramatically and also bring top level health care services to the most remote
      areas.\r\n\r\nMultisided platforms allow participants in tractions to have direct
      interaction with each other.  Examples would be Uber, Airbnb, and Craigslist."
